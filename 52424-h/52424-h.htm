<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The exploration of caves is rapidly becoming an important
field of inquiry, and their contributions to
our knowledge of the early history of the sojourn of
men in Europe are daily increasing in value and in
number. Since the year 1823, when Dr. Buckland
published his famous work, the “Reliquiæ Diluvianæ,”
no attempt has been made to correlate, and bring into
the compass of one work, the crude mass of facts which
have been recorded in nearly every country in Europe.
In this volume I have attempted to bring the history
of cave-exploration down to the knowledge of to-day,
and to put its main conclusions before my readers in
one connected and continuous narrative. Since Dr.
Buckland wrote, the momentous discovery of human
relics along with the extinct animals in caves and
river deposits has revolutionised the current ideas as
to the antiquity and condition of man; and works
of art of a high order, showing a familiarity with
nature and an aptitude for the delineation of the forms
of animals by no means despicable, have been discovered
in the caves of Britain, France, Belgium, and
Switzerland, that were the dwellings of the primeval
European hunters of reindeer and mammoths. The
discoveries in Kent’s Hole and in the caves of Belgium
led to those in the caves of Brixham and Wookey Hole,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
and finally to those of Auvergne and the south of
France, as well as of Germany and Switzerland.</p>

<p>Archæology, also, by the use of strictly inductive
methods, has grown from a mere antiquarian speculation
into a science; and its students have proved the truth of
the three divisions of human progress familiar to the
Greek and Roman philosopher, and expressed in the
pages of Hesiod and Lucretius&mdash;the Ages of Stone,
Bronze and Iron. The subdivision of the first of these
into the older, or palæolithic, and newer, or neolithic,
by Sir John Lubbock, is the only refinement which has
been made in this classification. Sir Charles Lyell has
discussed the various problems offered by the general
consideration of the first of these divisions in “The
Antiquity of Man;” while Sir John Lubbock, in
“Prehistoric Man,” has followed Dr. Keller and others
in working out the past history of mankind by a comparison
of the habitations, tombs, implements and
weapons found in Europe, with those of modern savages.
This work is intended to be to a considerable extent
supplementary to theirs,&mdash;to treat of the formation of
caves, and of the light thrown by their contents on the
sojourn of man in Europe, on the wild animals, and on
the changes in climate and geography.</p>

<p>In treating of the caves of the historic period, I have
given considerable prominence to the exploration of the
Victoria Cave, near Settle, which has led to the discovery
that many caverns were inhabited in this country
during the fifth and sixth centuries, and that they contain
works of art of a high order. In the difficult task of
bringing them into relation with British history and art,
I have to acknowledge the kind assistance of Mr. E.&nbsp;A.
Freeman, the Rev. J.&nbsp;R. Green, and Mr. A.&nbsp;W. Franks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
In the neolithic division of the prehistoric period, I
have published at length my recent discoveries in the
sepulchral caves of Denbighshire, and am allowed by my
friend, Professor Busk, to reprint his description of the
human bones. To his suggestive essay on the Gibraltar
caves, as well as to the works of the late Dr. Thurnam,
and of Professors Broca and Huxley, I am indebted for
the clue to the identification of the neolithic dwellers in
caves with the ancient Iberians or Modern Basques.
That portion of the evidence which relates to France I
have verified by a personal examination of the human
remains from caves and tombs in the Museums of
Bordeaux, Toulouse, Lyons and Paris.</p>

<p>The results of the exploration of the Hyæna-den
of Wookey Hole have been given in greater detail in
the portion of the work devoted to the palæolithic age
than they would have been, had they been before fully
recorded. And in this division of the subject I have
largely made use of the “Reliquiæ Aquitanicæ,” which
embodies the discoveries in Auvergne of my late friends
Professor E. Lartet and Mr. Christy. To the editors of
that work I am indebted for permission to use some of
the plates and letterpress.</p>

<p>The history of the pleistocene mammalia, in which
palæolithic man forms the central figure, has been my
especial study for many years. And the evidence which
is offered by the animals as to the geography and climate
of Europe, which I have published from time to time
in the works of the Palæontographical Society, the
<cite>Geological Journal</cite>, and in the <cite>Popular Science</cite>, <cite>British
Quarterly</cite>, and <cite>Edinburgh Reviews</cite>, is collected together
in this work, and brought into relation with the inquiry
into the extension of ice over Europe in the glacial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">x</a></span>
period, and into the soundings of the European seas.
In approaching these and the like problems, I have done
my best to arrive at the truth by visiting as far as
possible the foreign localities and collections, and by
correspondence with the discoverers of new facts.</p>

<p>In addition to those names which I have already
mentioned, I have to express my thanks to the Councils
of the Society of Antiquaries, the Geological Society, and
of the Anthropological Institute and to Mr. John Evans,
for the use of woodcuts; to Mr. Rooke Pennington for
looking over some of the proof sheets; and to Professors
Gaudry, Rütimeyer, Lortet, Nilsson, and Steenstrüp, and
the Rev. Canon Greenwell for aid of various kinds.
But especially do I feel grateful to my old friend and
master, the late lamented Professor Phillips, for frequent
help and prudent counsel.</p>

<p>In laying this book before my readers I would merely
further remark, that it is a faint outline of a new and
vast field of research, in which I have attempted to give
prominence to the more important points, rather than a
finished and detailed history of cave-exploration.</p>

in a rath at Ardagh, Limerick, and described by the Earl of Dunraven (Trans.
Royal Irish Acad. xxiv. Antiquities). The chalice is made of gold, silver, bronze,
brass, copper, and lead, and from the identity of its inscription and ornament
with those of Irish MSS. of ascertained age, may be referred to a date ranging
from the 5th to the 9th centuries. It is also adorned with squares of blue and
red enamel of the same kind as that of the brooches from the Victoria Cave,
figured in the coloured plate. The same design is also presented by the “bronze
head-ring” found in 1747 at Stitchel, in Roxburgh, (Wilson “Prehistoric Annals
of Scotland,” ii. 146) as well as by one of the silver articles known as “The
Norrie Law Relics,” found in a tumulus on the shore of the Bay of Largo,
Firth of Forth. Of the coins found at the same place, the latest, belonging to
Tiberius Constantine (d. 682), fixes the date as not earlier than the 7th century.
Some of the sculptured stones of Scotland, such as the Dunnichen stone, are
ornamented also in the same style, and, according to Professor Wilson, belong
to “the transition period from the 4th to the 8th centuries, when pagan and
Christian rites were obscurely mingled,” (ii. 259). In Scotland, therefore, as well
as Ireland, this style of ornamentation is of the same age, corresponding in the
main with that of Brit-Welsh articles in the Victoria Cave, proved by the associated
coins to be later than the 4th century.</p>

may possibly belong to that animal; but they may, with equal justice, be identified
with the wide-plated variety of the teeth of the Mammoth. The great
variation in the width of the component plates of the fossil teeth of Mammoth
observable in the large series from Crayford and the caves of the Mendip Hills,
and in those in the magnificent Museum of Lyons, causes me to hesitate in
considering them to belong to the rarer species.</p>

<p class="in0" id="hdr_1">Caves have excited the awe and wonder of mankind in
all ages, and have figured largely in many legends and
superstitions. In the Roman Mythology, they were the
abode of the Sibyls, and of the nymphs, and in Greece
they were the places where Pan, Bacchus, Pluto, and
the Moon were worshipped, and where the oracles were
delivered, as at Delphi, Corinth, and Mount Cithæron;
in Persia they were connected with the obscure worship
of Mithras. Their names, in many cases, are survivals
of the superstitious ideas of antiquity. In France and
Germany they are frequently termed “Fairy, Dragons’,
or Devils’ Caves,” and, according to M. Desnoyers, they
are mentioned in the invocation of certain canonized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
anchorites, who dwelt in them after having dispossessed
and destroyed the dragons and serpents, the pagan superstition
appearing in a Christian dress.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages they were looked upon as the
dwellings of evil spirits, into the unfathomable abysses
of which the intruder was lured to his own destruction.
Long after the fairies and little men had forsaken the
forests and glens of Northern Germany, they dwelt in
their palaces deep in the hearts of the mountains,&mdash;in
“the dwarf holes,” as they were called&mdash;whence
they came, from time to time, into the upper air.
Near Elbingrode, for example, in the Hartz, the legend
was current in the middle of the last century, that
when a wedding-dinner was being prepared the near
relations of the bride and bridegroom went to the
caves, and asked the dwarfs for copper and brass kettles,
pewter dishes and plates, and other kitchen utensils.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
“Then they retired a little, and when they came back,
found everything they desired set ready for them at the
mouth of the cave. When the wedding was over they
returned what they had borrowed, and in token
of gratitude, offered some meat to their benefactors.”
Allusions, such as this, to dwarfs, according to Professor
Nilsson, point back to the remote time when a small
primeval race, inhabiting Northern Germany, was driven
by invaders to take refuge in caverns,&mdash;a view that
derives support from the fact that in Scandinavia the
tall Northmen were accustomed to consider the smaller
Lapps and Finns as dwarfs, and to invest them with
magic power, just as in Palestine the smaller invading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
peoples considered their tall enemies giants. The cave
of Bauman’s hole, also in the Hartz district, was said, in
the middle of the last century, to have been haunted
by divers apparitions, and to contain a treasure guarded
by black mastiffs; and in Burrington Combe, in Somersetshire,
some twenty years ago, a cave was dug out by
a working man, under the impression that it contained
gold. The hills of Granada are still believed, by the
Moorish children, to contain the great Boabdil and his
sleeping host, who will awake when an adventurous
mortal invades their repose, and will issue forth to
restore the glory of the Moorish kings.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, no wonder that legends and poetical
fancies such as these should cluster round caves, for
the gloom of their recesses, and the shrill drip of the
water from the roof, or the roar of the subterranean
water-falls echoing through the passages, and the white
bosses of stalagmite looming like statues through the
darkness, offer ample materials for the use of a vivid imagination.
The fact that often their length was unknown,
naturally led to the inference that they were passages
into another world. And this is equally true of the
story of Boabdil, of that of the Purgatory of St. Patrick,
in the north of Ireland, and of the course of the river
Styx, which sinks into the rocks and flows through a
series of caverns that are the dark entrance-halls of
Hades. The same idea is evident in the remarkable
story, related by Ælian (Lib. xvi. 16). “Among the
Indians of Areia there is an abyss sacred to Pluto, and
beneath it vast galleries, and hidden passages and
depths, that have never been fathomed. How these
are formed the Indians tell not, nor shall I attempt to
relate. The Indians drive thither (every year) more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
than 3,000 different animals&mdash;sheep, goats, oxen, and
horses&mdash;and each acting either from dread of the dreadful
abyss, or to avert an evil omen in proportion to his
means, seeks his own and his family’s safety by causing
the animals to tumble in; and these, neither bound with
chains nor driven, of their own accord finish their
journey as if led on by some charm; and after they
have come to the mouth of the abyss they willingly
leap down, and are never more seen by mortal eyes.
The lowing, however, of the cattle, the bleating of the
sheep and of the goats, and the whinnying of the horses
are heard above ground, and if anyone listen at the
mouth, he will hear sounds of this kind lasting for a
long time. Nor do they ever cease, because beasts are
driven thither every day. But whether the sound is
made by those recently driven in, or by some of those
driven in some time before, I do not express an opinion.”
The Roman Catholic Church took advantage of this
feeling of superstitious awe, as late as the Middle Ages.
At the time of the Reformation it was believed that a cave
at Bishofferode would prove the death of some person in
the course of the year, unless a public yearly atonement
were made. Accordingly a priest came, on a certain
day, to the chapel on the hill opposite, whence he passed
in solemn procession to the cave, “and let down into it
a crucifix, which he pulled up again, and took this
occasion to remind them of hell, and to avoid the
punishment due to their sins.”</p>

<p>The beauty of the interiors of some of the caves
could not fail to give rise to more graceful fancies
than these. The fantastic shapes of the dripstone,
with which they are adorned, now resembling Gothic
pillars supporting a crystalline arcade, or jutting out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
in little spires and minarets, and very generally covering
the floor with a marble-like pavement, and in some
cases lining the pools of water with a fretwork of
crystals that shine like the facets of a diamond, were
fitting ornaments for the houses of unearthly beings,
such as fairies.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_2"><i>The Physical Division of the Subject.</i></h3>

<p>It is by no means my intention in this work to give a
history of legends such as these, but to take my readers
with me into some of the more important and more
beautiful caves in this country. The exploration of the
chambers and passages of which they are composed,
the fording of the subterranean streams by which they
are frequently traversed, or the descent into deep chasms
which open in their floors, have the peculiar charm
of mountaineering, not without a certain pleasurable
amount of risk. But to physicist and geologist they
offer far more than this. They give an insight into
the wonderful chemistry by which changes are being
wrought, at the present time, in the solid rock. Nor
are the conclusions to which we are led by the investigation
of these chemical changes merely confined to
the interior of caves. They enable us to understand
how some of the most beautiful scenery in Europe has
been formed, and to realize the mode by which all
precipices and gorges have been carved out of the
calcareous rock. In the next chapter we shall see why
it is that the combination of hill and valley, ravine
and precipice, present the same general features in all
limestone districts&mdash;why, for instance, the ravines of
Palestine are the same as those of Greece, and both are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
identical with those in Yorkshire. The origin and the
history of caves will be examined, as well as their relation
to the general physical geography of the calcareous
strata. All these subjects are comprehended in the first
or the physical division of cave-hunting.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_3"><i>The Biological Division.</i></h3>

<p>We must now proceed to the definition of the scope
and object of the second, or Biological, division of the
subject.</p>

<p id="hdr_4">Caves have been used by man, and the domestic
animals living under his protection, from the earliest
times recorded by history down to the present day.
Those penetrating the rugged precipices of Palestine, we
read in the Old Testament, served both for habitation
and for burial, and, from the notices which are scattered
through the early Greek writers, we may conclude that
those of Greece were used for dwelling-places. The
story of the Cyclops proves that they were also used as
folds for goats. The name of Troglodytes, given to many
peoples of the most remote antiquity, implies that there
was a time in the history of mankind when Pliny’s
statement “specus erat pro domibus” was strictly
true (“Hist. Nat.” I. v. c. 56). The caves of Africa
have been places of retreat from the remotest antiquity
down to the French conquest of Algeria, and in 1845
several hundred Arabs were suffocated in those of
Dahra by the smoke of a fire kindled at the entrance
by Marshal (then Colonel) Pelissier. Dr. Livingstone
alludes in his recent letters to the vast caves of Central
Africa, which offer refuge to whole tribes with their
cattle and household stuff. In France, according to M.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Desnoyers, there are at the present time whole villages,
including the church, to be found in the rock, which
are merely caves modified, extended, and altered by
the hand of man. The caves of the Dordogne were
inhabited in the middle ages. Floras writes that
the Aquitani, “callidum genus in speluncas se recipiebant,
Cæsar jussit includi,”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and the same caves afforded
shelter to the inhabitants of the same region in the wars
of King Pepin against the last Duke of Aquitaine. In
this country a small cave in Cheddar Pass was occupied
till within the last few years. The caves in the northern
counties are stated by Gildas to have offered a refuge to
the Brit-Welsh inhabitants of Britain during the raids
of the Picts and Scots; and in the year 1745 those of
Yorkshire were turned to the same purpose during the
invasion of the Pretender. We might reasonably expect
to find in caves turned to these uses objects left behind,
which would tell us something of the manners and
customs of their possessors, and light up the catalogue
of battles and intrigues of which history generally consists.
The results obtained from the Brit-Welsh group
of caves, treated in the <a href="#CHAPTER_III">third</a> chapter, show that this
hitherto neglected branch of the inquiry is not without
value to the historian.</p>

<p id="hdr_5">Caves containing remains of this kind may be conveniently
termed historic, because they may be brought
into relation with history. It must, however, be carefully
remarked that the term does not relate to history
<em>in general</em>, but to that <em>in particular</em> of each country
which happens to be under investigation. The misapprehension
of this has caused great confusion, and many
mistakes in archæological classification and reasoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Again, our experience of the habits of rude and uncivilized
peoples would naturally lead us to look to caves,
as the places in which we should be likely to meet with
the remains of the men who lived in Europe before the
dawn of history. Such remains we do find that, placed
side by side with others from the tombs and dwellings,
enable us to discover some, at least, of the races who
lived in Europe in long-forgotten times, and to ascertain
roughly the sequence of events in the remote past, far
away from the historical border. It may, indeed, seem
a hopeless quest to recover what has been buried in
oblivion so long, and it is successful merely through the
careful comparison of the human skeletons in the caves
and tombs of Britain, France, and Spain, with those of
existing races, and of the implements and weapons with
those which are now used among savage tribes. By this
means we shall see that there are good grounds for extending
the range of the Iberian people over a considerable
area in Europe, and for the belief that the Eskimos
once lived as far south as Auvergne. In discussing both
these problems it will be impossible to shut our eyes to
the continuity that exists between geology, archæology,
biology, and history&mdash;sciences which at first sight appear
isolated from each other.</p>

<p>The bones of the domestic animals in the caves will
necessarily lead to the further examination of the appearance
and disappearance of breeds under the care of man.
And this complicated question has an important bearing
not merely on the ethnology, but also on the history, of
some of the European peoples. It must be admitted,
however, that this branch of the subject is, as yet, known
merely in outline, and we can only hope to ascertain a
few facts which may form a basis for future investigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
From another point of view the contents of caves are
peculiarly valuable. They have been used as places of
shelter, not merely by man, but by wild animals, from
the time they first became accessible to the present
day. In the same way, therefore, as now they contain,
in their superficial layers, the bones of sheep, oxen,
and horses, foxes, rabbits, and badgers, so in their deeper
strata lie buried the remains of the animals which were
living in Europe long before the historic times. In
other words, they enable us to make out the groups
of animals inhabiting the neighbouring districts, and
which in many cases have either forsaken their original
abodes or have become extinct. And since those
which are extinct, or which have migrated, could not
have lived where their remains are found under the present
conditions of life, an inquiry into their history leads
us into the general question of the ancient European
climate and geography. It is obvious, for example, that
the spotted hyæna, which formerly inhabited the caves
of Sicily, could not have crossed over to that island after
it was separated from Africa and Italy; and it would be
impossible for the musk-sheep, the most arctic of the
herbivora, to live as far south as Auvergne under the
present climatal conditions. The presence, therefore, of
these animals in these districts is proof in the one case
of a geographical, and in the other of a climatal, change.</p>

<p>The discussion of all these questions is comprehended
under the second, or biological, division of cave-hunting,
which may be defined as an inquiry into the remains of
man and animals found in the caves, and into the conditions
under which they lived in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_6"><i>The three Classes of Bone-caves.</i></h3>

<p>In the biological branch of the subject the caves
will be treated first which are comprehended within
the limits of history; then we shall pass on to the
investigation of Prehistoric caves, or those which have
been inhabited in the interval that separates history
from the remote geological era, which is characterized
by the existence of the extinct mammalia in Europe.
And, lastly, those will be examined which have furnished
the remains of the extinct animals, and which
are termed by the geologists Pleistocene, from the
fact that a larger percentage of existing species were
then living than in the preceding Pleio-, Meio-, and
Eocene periods. The equivalent terms “Quaternary,”
used by many French geologists, and the “Post-pleiocene
division of the Post-tertiary Formation,” used by
Sir Charles Lyell, are not adopted in this work, because
they imply a break in the continuity of life, which does
not exist. “Pleistocene” was invented and subsequently
discarded by Sir C. Lyell,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and is at present
used by many eminent writers, such as Forbes, Phillips,
Gervais, and others. The ossiferous caves will therefore
be divided into the Historic, Prehistoric, and Pleistocene
groups. And it will be more convenient to work backwards
in time from the basis offered by history, than to
begin with the Pleistocene, or oldest division, and bring
the narrative down to the present day.</p>

<p>This classification, founded in part on the principle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
of change in the animal world, and partly on the basis
offered by history, coincides, only in part, with that
of the archæologists based on the remains of man’s
handiwork. The Pleistocene age is the equivalent of
the Palæolithic, or that of rude unpolished stone; the
Prehistoric represents the ages of polished stone, bronze,
and iron in part, or those stages in human progress when
the use of these materials became general for the purposes
of every-day life; while the Historic covers merely
the later portion of that of iron.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_7"><i>History of Cave-Exploration in Europe.</i></h3>

<p id="hdr_8"><i>Germany.</i>&mdash;The rest of this chapter must be devoted to
an outline of the history of cave-exploration during the last
two centuries. The dread of the supernatural, which preserved
the European caves from disturbance, was destroyed
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by the search
after “ebur fossile,” or unicorn’s horn, which ranked high
in the materia medica of those days as a specific for
many diseases, and which was obtained, in great abundance,
in the caverns of the Hartz, and in those of
Hungary and Franconia. As the true nature of the drug
gradually revealed itself, the German caves became
famous for the remains of the lions, hyænas, fossil
elephants, and other strange animals, which had been
used for medicine. We owe the first philosophical discussion
on the point to Dr. Gesner,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> who, although he
maintained that the fossil unicorn consisted, in some
cases, of elephant’s teeth and tusks, and in others of
its fossil bones, did not altogether give up the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
its medicinal value. It is a singular fact, that fossil
remains of a similar kind are, at the present time, used
by the Chinese for the same purpose, and sold in their
druggists’ shops.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The cave which was most famous at
the end of the seventeenth century was that of Bauman’s
Hole, in the Hartz, in the district of Blankenbourg. It
is noticed in the Philosophical Transactions for the year
1662, and was subsequently described by Dr. Behrens,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
Leibnitz, De Luc, and Cuvier, along with others in the
neighbourhood. Those of Hungary come next in point
of discovery, the first notice of them being due to Patterson
Hayne in 1672. They penetrate the southern
slopes of the Carpathian ranges, and are known by the
name of dragons’ caves, because the bones which they
contain had been considered from time immemorial to
belong to those animals by the country people. These
remains were identified by Baron Cuvier as belonging to
the cave-bear.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>It was not, however, until the close of the eighteenth
century that the exploring of caves was carried on systematically,
or their contents examined with any scientific
precision. The caves of Franconia, in the neighbourhood
of Muggendorf, were described by Esper in 1774, by
Rosenmuller in 1804, and six years later by Dr. Goldfuss.
The most important was that of Gailenreuth, both from
the vast quantity of remains which it was proved to
contain, and the investigations to which it led. The
bones of the hyæna, lion, wolf, fox, glutton, and red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
deer were identified by Baron Cuvier; while some of the
skulls which Dr. Goldfuss obtained have been recently
proved, by Professor Busk, to belong to the grizzly bear.
They were associated with the bones of the reindeer,
horse and bison. Rosenmuller was of opinion that the
cave had been inhabited by bears for a long series of
generations; and he thus realized that these remains
proved that the animals found in the cave had once
lived in that district, and had not been swept from
the tropics by the deluge. The interest in these discoveries
was at its height in the year 1816, when Dr.
Buckland visited the cave, and acquired that knowledge
of cave-exploring which he was subsequently to use
with such good effect in this country.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> From this
time down to the present day, no new fact of importance
has been added to our knowledge of caves
by explorations in Germany.</p>

<p id="hdr_9"><i>Great Britain.</i>&mdash;The first bone-cave systematically
explored in this country was that discovered by Mr.
Whidbey,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> in the Devonian limestone at Oreston, near
Plymouth, in 1816; and the remains obtained from it
were identified by Sir Everard Home as implying the
existence of the rhinoceros in that region. This discovery
followed close upon the researches in Gailenreuth,
and was due in some degree to the request which Sir
Joseph Banks made, that Mr. Whidbey, in quarrying the
stone for the Plymouth breakwater, should examine the
contents of any caverns that he might happen to meet
with. It preceded Dr. Buckland’s exploration of Kirkdale
by about four years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
In the summer of 1821 a cave was discovered, in a
limestone quarry at Kirkdale, in Yorkshire, which was
found to contain bones and teeth of animals. On hearing
of the discovery, Dr. Buckland posted at once from South
Wales to the spot, and published the result of the explorations
in the Philosophical Transactions for the next
year. He brought forward evidence that the cave had
been inhabited by hyænas, and that the broken and
gnawed bones of the rhinoceros, mammoth, stag, bison,
and horse belonged to animals which had been dragged
in for food. He also established the fact that all these
animals had lived in Yorkshire in ancient times, and that
it was impossible for the carcases of the hyæna, rhinoceros,
and mammoth to have been floated from those
regions where they are now living into the position where
he found their bones. He subsequently followed up the
subject by investigating bone-caves in Derbyshire, South
Wales, and Somerset, as well as in Germany, and published
his great work, “Reliquiæ Diluvianæ,” in 1822,
which laid the foundations of the new science of cave-hunting
in this country. The exploration of Kirkdale
followed closely upon that of Gailenreuth, and was merely
the application of those principles of research which had
been discovered in Germany to caves in a new district.</p>

<p>From this time forward bone-caves were discovered in
Great Britain in increasing numbers, and explored by
many independent observers. The famous cavern of Kent’s
Hole, near Torquay, furnished the Rev. J. McEnery,
between 1825 and the year 1841, in which he died,
with the first flint implements ever discovered in a
cave along with the bones of extinct animals. He recognized
the fact that they may be proof of the existence
of man during the time that those animals were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
alive; but the scientific world was not then sufficiently
educated to accept the antiquity of the human race on
the evidence brought forward, and Dr. Buckland himself
was so influenced by the opinions of his times, that he
refused even to entertain the idea. Although the
discovery was verified by the independent researches of
Mr. Godwin Austin in 1840, and by the Torquay
Natural History Society in 1846, the force of prejudice
was so strong, that the matter was not thought even
worthy of investigation. Mr. McEnery’s manuscripts
were lost until the year 1859, when an abstract of them
was published by Mr. Vivian, and subsequently they
were printed in full by Mr. Pengelly, the able superintendent
of the exploration which has been carried on
by a committee of the British Association since 1865, by
whom several thousand flint implements have been obtained,
under the conditions pointed out by the Rev. J.
McEnery and Mr. Godwin Austen.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>While the important question of the antiquity of man
was being passed by as of no account, other caves were
being examined in this country. Those of Banwell,
Burrington, Sandford Hill, Bleadon, and Hutton, in the
mountain limestone of the Mendip hills, were being
worked by the Rev. J. Williams and Mr. Beard, and
furnished the magnificent collection of mammalian bones
now in the museum at Taunton. In North Wales, also, Mr.
Lloyd discovered a similar suite of bones in the limestone
caves in the neighbourhood of St. Asaph at Cefn,
and in South Wales numerous remains were obtained by
many explorers in those of Pembrokeshire and Gower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
The result of these discoveries was the proof that
certain extinct animals, such as the woolly rhinoceros
and the mammoth, had lived in this country in ancient
times, along with two other groups of species which are
at present known only to live in hot and cold climates&mdash;the
spotted hyæna and hippopotamus of Africa, with the
reindeer and the marmot of the colder regions of the
earth.</p>

<p>The discovery in 1858, and the exploration, of the now
famous cave of Brixham, by the Royal and Geological
Societies, marked the dawn of a new era in cave-hunting.
Under the careful supervision of Mr. Pengelly, flint
implements were discovered underneath stalagmite,
and in association with the remains of the hyæna and
woolly rhinoceros and mammoth, in undisturbed red
loam, under conditions that prove man to have been
living in Devonshire at the same time as those animals.
This singularly opportune discovery destroyed for ever
the doubts that had overhung the question of the
antiquity of man, and of his co-existence in Europe
in company with the animals whose remains occur both
in the caverns and river-deposits.</p>

<p>In 1847 M. Boucher de Perthes described certain
rude flint implements that he obtained from the fluviatile
gravels of Abbeville (“Antiquités Celtiques,”
vol. i.), along with the bones of extinct animals; and his
discovery was treated with the same scepticism in France
as that of the Rev. J. McEnery in England, although it
was verified by flint implements being discovered, under
exactly the same conditions, in the gravels of Amiens,
some forty miles away, by Dr. Rigollot.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> In the autumn
of 1858, Dr. Falconer, who had been superintending the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
work in the Brixham cave, visited the collection made by
M. de Perthes, while on his way to examine the caves of
Sicily, and recognizing man’s handiwork in the implements,
he asked his friend Mr. Prestwich to explore the
Valley of the Somme. This he accordingly did, and in
company with Mr. John Evans, F.R.S., dug out with his
own hands an implement from the undisturbed strata,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
and thus finally settled the disputed question. It is
undoubtedly true, that scientific opinion was tending
towards the acceptance of the evidence in favour of man
having lived in Europe in the Pleistocene age; but the
researches in Brixham cave established the fact on the
highest possible authority, and confirmed the long-neglected
discoveries in the valley of the Somme. By
the end of 1859 it was fully accepted by the scientific
world, and caused the exploration of caves to be carried
on with increased vigour.</p>

<p>In December 1859,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> I began the exploration of the
hyæna-den of Wookey Hole, near Wells, Somerset, in
company with the Rev. J. Williamson, and obtained
flint instruments along with the remains of the mammoth,
hyæna, woolly rhinoceros, and other animals, under
conditions that proved the contemporaneity of man with
the extinct mammalia. And from that time down to
the present date I have carried on researches in caves
in various parts of Great Britain. In the district of
Gower also, many ossiferous caverns were investigated,
in 1858&ndash;9&ndash;60&ndash;1 by Colonel Wood and Dr. Falconer, and
in one of them flint implements were obtained along with
the bones of the extinct mammalia.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Kent’s Hole, begun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
in 1865 by the British Association, and still being worked,
furnishes annually a vast number of bones and teeth of
hyænas, rhinoceroses, cave-bears, and horses, and other
animals, along with flint and bone implements.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>In 1869 I had the good fortune to discover, and
subsequently to explore, a group of sepulchral caves in
Denbighshire, which had been used by an Iberian or
Basque race in the Neolithic age (Chapter V.); and
in the following year the Settle Cave Committee began
their work in Yorkshire under my advice. And this
has led to the important conclusion, that a group of
caves, extending over a wide area in the centre and
north of England, was occupied by the Brit-Welsh in the
obscure interval which elapsed between the departure of
the Roman legions and the English conquest.</p>

<p id="hdr_10"><i>France.</i>&mdash;The researches of Buckland into the caves
of Great Britain, and of Goldfuss and others into those
of Germany, and more especially the publication of
the “Ossemens Fossiles,” by Cuvier, gave an impetus
to cave-exploration in France which yielded the same
results as in our own country. The mammalia obtained
from the cave of Fouvent (Haut Saone) in 1800 were
described in the “Ossemens,” as well as those from
Gondenans. In the Gironde, the Cave of Avison was
explored by M. Billaudel in 1826&ndash;27. In the south,
Marcel de Serres, aided by MM. Dubrueil and Jeanjean,
examined the important Cave of Lunel-viel in 1824,
and published their results in a work that holds the
same position in France as the “Reliquiæ Diluvianæ”
in England. The caverns of Pondres, Souvignargues, and
of Bize were explored, the two first by M. Christol
in 1829, the last by M. Tournal in 1833, and those of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Villefranche (Pyrénées-orient), Mialet (Gard), and
Nabrigas (Lozère) were described by De Serres in
1839, who subsequently added those of Carcas-sonne
to the list in 1842. In this year MM. Prevost and
J. Desnoyers explored the caves of Montmorency in
the neighbourhood of Paris, and described the remains
discovered in those of Bicêtre. The Cave of Pontil
(Hérault) described by M. de Serres in 1847, was
proved in 1864, by Professor Gervais, to contain
two distinct strata, the neolithic lying over the palæolithic,
as in Kent’s Hole.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>In 1860,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> the famous Cave of Aurignac was proved, by
the investigations of Professor Lartet, to have been inhabited
by man in the life-time of the extinct mammalia.
Three years later the caves of Périgord were explored
by that gentleman, along with Mr. Christy, and yielded
results which mark a new era in the history of man in
the remote past. From the remarkable collection of implements
and weapons, the habits and mode of life of the
occupants can be ascertained with tolerable certainty,
and from their comparison with the like articles now in
use among savage tribes, it may be reasonably inferred
that they were closely related in blood to the Eskimos.
This most important question will be investigated in its
proper place, in the chapter relating to the palæolithic
caves of France. Professor Lartet, M. Louis Lartet, Sir
Charles Lyell, and other eminent observers believe further,
that the interments that have been discovered in Aurignac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
and in Cro Magnon,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> in Périgord, are to be assigned
to the same relative age as the occupation of the caves
by man. From the fact, however, that the skeletons
in both these cases were <em>above</em> the strata accumulated by
the palæolithic cave-dwellers, it may be concluded that
they were deposited after those strata were formed, in
other words, that they are of a later age.</p>

<p>From 1863 down to the present time very many caves
have been explored in France without any further addition
to our knowledge, excepting the verification of the
facts, afforded by the caves of Brixham and of Périgord,
as to the co-existence of man with the extinct mammalia,
and his probable identity in race with the Eskimos.</p>

<p id="hdr_11"><i>Belgium.</i>&mdash;The caves of Belgium<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> have afforded evidence
of precisely the same nature as those of England
and France. Dr. Schmerling, of Liège, published the
results of his researches, begun in 1829, into the bone-caves
on the banks of the Meuse and its tributaries, in
1833&ndash;4, and proved that the mammoth, rhinoceros, cave-bear,
and hyæna formerly lived in that district. He also
arrived at the conclusion that man was living at that
remote time, from the discovery of flint-flakes and human
bones along with the remains of those animals in the
caves of Engis and Engihoul. In 1853,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Professor Spring
discovered a quantity of burned, broken, and cut bones
belonging to women and children, in the Cave of
Chauvaux, which he considered to imply that it had been
inhabited by a family of cannibals. Axes of polished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
stone were also met with, that indicated the relative age
to be neolithic.</p>

<p>To pass over the human skeleton found in the Neanderthal
Cave in 1857 by Dr. Fuhlroth, which is of
doubtful antiquity, the next discoveries of importance
are those made by M. Dupont in the years 1864&ndash;70, in
the province of Namur, that established the fact that the
same race of men who inhabited Auvergne in the palæolithic
age had also lived in Belgium. M. Dupont considers
that the interments in the Trou de Frontal<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> belong
also to the palæolithic age, and that therefore man at
that remote time was possessed of religious ideas. Before,
however, this view can be accepted, it will be necessary
to show the exact relation of the bones of the reindeer,
chamois, mammoth, and other animals found outside the
slab of stone, at the mouth of the sepulchral chamber, to
the human remains within. In this case, as in Aurignac
and Cro Magnon, the evidence seems to me insufficient
to establish so important a conclusion.</p>

<p id="hdr_12"><i>Southern Europe.</i>&mdash;In southern Europe the bone-caves
of Sicily, worked in 1829 for the sake of the animal
remains to be used in sugar refining, were scientifically
examined by Dr. Falconer in 1859; those of Malta by
Captain Spratt in the same year; and those of Gibraltar by
Captain Broome in the years 1862&ndash;8. They established
the existence of the serval and the African elephant, and
other characteristic African species, in Europe, and offer
as we shall see in this work, important testimony as to
the geography of the Mediterranean area in the Pleistocene
age.</p>

<p>In this outline of the history of cave-exploration it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
will be seen, that the additions to our knowledge of the
past have been neither few nor insignificant, nor in one
line of inquiry. And if the attention which is now being
directed to the subject be due to the general development
of scientific thought, it is equally true, that the results
have reacted on scientific thought in general, and have
especially benefited the sciences of geology, archæology,
and history. A rich field of investigation lies before the
cave-hunter, in Greece, Palestine, Lycia, Persia, and the
limestone plateaux of central Asia; and since these
discoveries have been so valuable in central and north-western
Europe, what may we not recover from the
grasp of oblivion, of the infancy and early culture of
mankind in the very birth-place and “pathway of the
nations”?</p>

<h3 id="hdr_13"><i>Caves formed by the Sea and by Volcanic Action.</i></h3>

<p class="in0">In this chapter we shall treat of the origin of caves and
of their place in physical geography. The most obvious
agent in hollowing out caves is the sea. The set of the
current, the tremendous force of the breakers, and the
grinding of the shingle, inevitably discover the weak
places in the cliff, and leave caves as the results of their
work, modified in each case by the local conditions of
the rock. Caves formed in this manner have certain
characters which are easily recognized. Their floors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
are very rarely much out of the horizontal, their outlook
is over the sea, and they very seldom penetrate
far into the cliff. A general parallelism is also to be
observed in a group in the same district, and their
entrances are all in the same horizontal plane, or in
a succession of horizontal and parallel planes. In some
cases they are elevated above the present reach of
the waves, and mark the line at which the sea formerly
stood. From their generally inaccessible position sea-caves
have very rarely been occupied by man, and the
history of their formation is so obvious that it requires
no further notice. Among them the famous Fingal’s
Cave, off the north coast of Ireland, and that of Staffa,
on the opposite shore of Scotland, hollowed out of
columnar basalt, are perhaps the most remarkable in
Europe.</p>

<p>In volcanic regions also there are caves formed by
the passage of lava to the surface of the ground, or by
the imprisoned steam and gases in the lava while it was
in a molten state: but these are of comparatively little
importance so far as relates to the general question of
caves, from the very small areas which are occupied by
active volcanoes in Europe. They have been observed in
Vesuvius, Etna, Iceland, and Teneriffe.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_14"><i>Caves in Arenaceous Rocks.</i></h3>

<p>Caves also occur sometimes in sandstones, in which
case they are the result of the erosion of the lines of the
joints by the passage of subaërial water, and if the joints
happen to traverse a stratum less compacted than the
rest, the weak point is discovered, and a hollow is formed
extending laterally from the original fissure. The massive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
millstone grit of Derbyshire and Yorkshire present many
examples of this, as for instance in Kinderscout in the
former county. The rocks at Tunbridge Wells also show
to what extent the joints in the Wealden sandstones may
become open fissures, more or less connected with caves,
on a small scale, by the mere mechanical action of water.
M. Desnoyers gives instances of the same kind in the
Tertiary sandstones of the Paris basin, which have furnished
remains of rhinoceros, reindeer, hyæna, and bear.
Caverns, however, in the sandstone are rarely of great
extent, and may be passed over as being of small importance
in comparison with those in the calcareous
rocks.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_15"><i>Caves in Calcareous Rocks of various ages.</i></h3>

<p>It has long been known that wherever the calcareous
strata are sufficiently hard and compact to support a
roof, caves are to be found in greater or less abundance.
Those of Devonshire occur in the Devonian limestone;
those of Somerset, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire,
and Northumberland, as well as of Belgium and
Westphalia, in that of the carboniferous age. In France
also, those of Maine and Anjou, and most of those of the
Pyrenees and in the department of Aude, are hollowed
in carboniferous limestone, as well as the greater part of
those in North America, in Virginia, and Kentucky.
The cave of Kirkdale in Yorkshire, and most of those in
Franconia and in Bavaria penetrate Jurassic limestones,
which have received the name of Hohlenkalkstein from
the abundance of caverns which they contain. They are
developed on a large scale in the Swiss and French Jura,
and in some cases afford passage to powerful streams,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
and in others are more or less filled with ice, thus
constituting the singular “glacières” that have been so
ably explored by the Rev. G.&nbsp;F. Browne.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>The compact Neocomian and Cretaceous limestones
contain most of the caverns of Périgord, Quercy, and
Angoumois, and some of those in Provence and Languedoc,
those of Northern Italy, Sicily, Greece, Dalmatia,
Carniola, and Turkey in Europe, of Asia Minor and
Palestine.</p>

<p>The tertiary limestones, writes M. Desnoyers,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> offer
sometimes, but very rarely, caves that have become
celebrated for the bones which they contain, such as
those of Lunel-Viel, near Montpelier, those of Pondres
and Souvignargues, near Sommières (Gard), and of Saint
Macaire (Gironde). The same may also be said of the
calcaire grossier of the basin of Paris.</p>

<p>Certain rocks composed of gypsum also contain caverns
of the same sort as those in the limestones. In Thuringia,
for example, near Eisleben, they occur in the saliferous
and gypseous strata of the zechstein, and are connected
with large gulfs and cirques on the surface, which are
sometimes filled with water. In the neighbourhood of
Paris, and especially at Montmorency, they contain
numerous bones of the extinct mammalia. M. Desnoyers
points out their identity, in all essentials, with those
in calcareous strata, and infers that they have been
produced in the same way. Some of them may
have been formed by the removal of the salt, which
is very frequently interbedded with the gypsum, by
the passage of water. In Cheshire the pumping of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
brine from the saliferous and gypseous strata produces
subterranean hollows, which sometimes fall in and
eventually cause depressions on the surface, such as
those which are now destroying the town of Northwich,
and causing the neighbouring tidal estuary to extend
over what was formerly meadow land. This explanation,
however, will not apply to those in the neighbourhood
of Paris, because there is no trace of their ever having
contained salt.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_16"><i>The Relation of Caves to Pot-holes, “Cirques,” and Ravines.</i></h3>

<p>The caverns hollowed in calcareous rocks present
features by which they are distinguished from any others.
They open, for the most part, on the abrupt sides of
valleys and ravines at various levels, being arranged
round the main axis of erosion just as branches are
arranged round the trunk of a tree&mdash;as, for example, in
Cheddar Pass. The transition in some cases from the valley
to the ravine, and from the ravine to the cave, is so
gradual, that it is impossible to deny that all three are
due to the same cause. The caves themselves ramify in
the same irregular fashion as the valleys, and are to be
viewed merely as the capillaries in the general valley
system, through which the rainfall passes to join the
main channels. Very frequently, however, the drainage
has found an outlet at a lower level, and its ancient
passage is left dry; but in all cases unmistakeable proof
of the erosive action of water is to be seen in the sand,
gravel, and clay which compose the floor, as well as in
the worn surfaces of the sides and the bottom.</p>

<p>In all districts in which caves occur are funnel-shaped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
cavities of various sizes, known as “pot-holes” or
“swallow-holes” in Britain, as “betoires,” “chaldrons du
diable,” “marmites de géants,” in France, and as “kata-vothra”
in Greece, in which the rainfall is collected before
it finally disappears in the subterranean passages. They
are to be seen in all stages; sometimes being mere shallow
funnels, that only contain water after excessive rain, and
at others as profound vertical shafts, into which the
water is continually falling, as in Helln Pot, in Yorkshire.
The cirques, also, described by M. Desnoyers, belong to
the same class of cavities, although all those which are
mentioned by the Rev. T.&nbsp;G. Bonney,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> at the head of
valleys, and in some cases hollowed in shale and igneous
rocks, are most probably to be referred to the vertical,
chisel-like action of streams flowing under physical
conditions, that resemble those under which the cañons
of the Colorado, or of the Zambesi, are being excavated,
and in which frost, ice, and snow have played
a very subordinate part.</p>

<p>The intimate relation between pot-holes, caves, ravines,
and valleys will be discussed in the rest of this chapter,
and illustrated by English examples; and then we shall
proceed to show that the chemical action of the carbonic
acid in the rain-water, and the mechanical friction of the
sand and gravel, set in motion by the water, by which
Professor Phillips explains the origin of caves, will
equally explain the pot-holes and ravines by which they
are invariably accompanied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_17"><i>The Water-Cave of Wookey Hole, near Wells, Somerset.</i></h3>

<p>Caves may be divided into two classes: those which
are now mere passages for water, in which the history of
their formation may be studied, and those which are dry,
and capable of affording shelter to man and the lower
animals. Among the water-caves, that of Wookey Hole<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
is to be noticed first, since its very name implies that it
was known to the Celtic inhabitants of the south of
England, and since it was among the first, if not the first,
of those examined with any care in this country, Mr.
John Beaumont<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> having brought it before the notice of
the Royal Society in the year 1680.</p>

<p>The hamlet of Wookey Hole nestles in a valley,
through which flows the river Axe, and the valley passes
insensibly, at its upper end, into a ravine, which is closed
abruptly by a wall of rock (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>), about two hundred
feet high, covered with long streamers and festoons of
ivy, and affording scanty hold, on its ledges and in its
fissures, to ferns, brambles, and ash saplings. At its base
the river Axe issues, in full current, out of the cave, the
lower entrance of which it completely blocks up, since
the water has been kept back by a weir, for the use of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
paper-mill a little distance away. A narrow path through
the wood, on the north side of the ravine, leads to the
only entrance now open.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Thence a narrow passage leads
downward into the rock, until, suddenly, you find yourself
in a large chamber, at the water level. Then you pass
over a ridge, covered with a delicate fretwork of dripstone,
with each tiny hollow full of water, and ornamented with
brilliant lime crystals. One shapeless mass of dripstone
is known in local tradition as the Witch of Wookey,
turned into stone by the prayers of a Glastonbury monk.
Beyond this the chamber expands considerably, being
some seventy or eighty feet high, and adorned with
beautiful stalactites, far out of the reach of visitors. The
water, which bars further entrance, forms a deep pool,
which Mr. James Parker managed to cross on a raft (see
<a href="#APPENDIX_I">Appendix I</a>.) into another chamber, which was apparently
easy of access before the construction of the weir.
It was in this further chamber that Dr. Buckland found
human remains and pottery.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Diagram of Wookey Hole Cave and Ravine.</div></div>

<p>The cave has been proved to extend as far as the
village of Priddy, about two miles off, on the Mendip hills,
by the fact observed by Mr. Beaumont, that the water
used in washing the lead ore at that spot, in his time,
found its way into the river Axe, and poisoned cattle in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the valley of Wookey. And this observation has been
verified during the last few years by throwing in colour
and chopped straw. The stream at Priddy sinks into a
swallow-hole (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>), and has its subterranean course
determined by the southerly dip of the rock, by which
the joints running north and south afford a more free
passage to the water than those running east and west.
The cave is merely a subterranean extension of the ravine
in the same line, as far as the swallow-hole, and all
three have been hollowed, as we shall see presently, by
the action of the stream and of carbonic acid in the
water.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_18"><i>The Goatchurch Cave.</i></h3>

<p>The largest cavern in the Mendip hills is that locally
known as the Goatchurch, which opens on the eastern
side of the lower of the two ravines that branch from the
magnificent defile of Burrington Combe, about two miles
from the village of Wrington, at the height of about
120 feet from the bottom of the ravine. After creeping
along a narrow, muddy passage, with a steep descent to
the west, at an angle of about 30°, you suddenly pass
into a stalactitic chamber of considerable height and
size. From it two small vertical shafts lead into the
lower set of chambers and passages; the first being
blocked up, and the second being close to a large barrel-shaped
stalagmite, to which Mr. Ayshford Sanford, Mr.
James Parker, and myself fastened our ropes when we
explored the cave in 1864. The latter affords access
into a passage, beautifully arched, and passing horizontally
east and west, and just large enough to admit a man
walking upright. At the further end numerous open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
fissures, caused by the erosion of the joints in the limestone,
cross it at right angles, and pass into several ill-defined
chambers, partially stalactitic, but for the most
part filled with loose, bare, cubical masses of limestone.
Two of the transverse fissures lead into a large chamber,
at a lower level. At its lower end, on crawling along
a narrow passage, we came into a second chamber,
also of considerable height and depth, at the bottom of
which the noise of flowing water can be heard through
two vertical holes, just large enough to admit of access.
On sliding down one of these we found ourselves in a
third chamber, which was traversed by a subterranean
stream, doubtless in part the same which disappears
in the ravine, at a point eighty feet above by
aneroid measurement. The temperature of the water,
as compared with that of the stream outside (49° : 59°),
renders it very probable that, between the point of disappearance
in the ravine and reappearance in the cave,
it is joined by a stream of considerable subterranean
length, since the water could not have lost ten degrees
in the short interval which it had to traverse, were it
supplied only from the stream in the ravine. From
the point of its disappearance in the cave, the water
passes downwards to join the main current flowing
underneath Burrington Combe, that gushes forth in great
volume at Rickford. The lowest portion of the cave
was eighteen or twenty feet below the stream, and 220
feet below the entrance of the cavern.</p>

<p>On examining the floors of the chambers and passages,
we discovered that they were composed of the same kind
of sediment as that which is now being deposited by the
water in Wookey Hole, and there could be no doubt but
that they had been originally traversed by water. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
this to have taken place it is necessary to suppose that,
while the Goatchurch was a water cave, the ravine on
which it opens was not deeper than the entrance&mdash;in other
words, that in the interval between the formation and
excavation of the chambers and passages, to the present
time, the ravine has been excavated in the limestone to
a depth of a hundred and twenty feet, and the water
which originally passed through the entrance has found
its way, by a new series of passages, to the point where
it appears at the bottom of the cave.</p>

<p>We obtained evidence that the horizontal passage,
immediately below the first vertical descent, had been
inhabited at a very remote period. At the spot where
Mr. Beard, of Banwell, obtained a fine tusk of mammoth,
we found a molar of bear, and a fragment of
flint, which were imbedded in red earth, and were underneath
a crust of stalagmite of about two inches in thickness.
It would follow from this, that the date of the
formation of this part of the cave was before the time
when the traces of elephants, bears, and of man were
introduced.</p>

<p>The cave is the resort of numerous badgers. On hiding
ourselves in one of the transverse fissures, and
throwing our light across the horizontal passage, these
animals ran to and fro across the lighted field with extraordinary
swiftness, and had it not been for the white
streaks on the sides of their heads, which flashed back
the light, they would not have been observed. Though
they are rarely caught, they must be abundant in the
district.</p>

<p>Like all the other large caverns in the district, it has its
legends. The dwellers in the neighbourhood, who have
never cared to explore its recesses, relate that a certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
dog put in here found its way out, after many days, at
Wookey Hole, having lost all its hair in scrambling
through the narrow passages. At Cheddar the same
legend is appropriated to the Cheddar cave. At Wookey
the dog is said to have travelled back to Cheddar. Some
eighteen years ago, while exploring the limestone caves
at Llanamynech, on the English border of Montgomeryshire,
I met with a similar story. A man playing the
bagpipes is said to have entered one of the caves, well
provisioned with Welsh mutton, and after he had been
in for some time his bagpipes were heard two miles from
the entrance, underneath the small town of Llanamynech.
He never returned to tell his tale. The few bones found
in the cave are supposed to be those which he had picked
on the way. This is doubtless another form of the story
of the dog; both owe their origin to the vague impression,
which most people have, of the great extent of
caverns, and both versions are equally current in France
and Germany.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_19"><i>The Water-caves of Derbyshire.</i></h3>

<p>The celebrated cavern of the Peak, at Castleton in
Derbyshire, presents the same essential character as that
of Wookey Hole. It runs into the hill-side at the end
of the ravine, and is traversed by a powerful stream of
water, which has been met with in driving an horizontal
adit in lead-mining at a considerable distance from the
entrance, and finally traced to a distant swallow-hole.
At a little distance from Buxton a smaller cave, known
as Poole’s Cavern, is in part traversed by water, which
has found an outlet at a lower level, and allowed of
the present entrance being used by the Brit-Welsh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
(Romano-Celtic) inhabitants of the district as a habitation
in the fifth and sixth centuries.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> There are, besides
these, very many others, some known, others unknown,
that debouch on the sides of the dales in Derbyshire
and Staffordshire, and are all well worthy of examination,
since they illustrate not merely the history of
the formation of caves, but also have been proved to
contain works of art, pottery and flint implements,
and the remains of animals, such as the mammoth and
rhinoceros.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_20"><i>The Water-caves of Yorkshire.</i></h3>

<p>The caves in the mountain limestone of Yorkshire
rival in size those of Carniola, or those of Greece, and
they are to be seen in all stages of formation. In their
gloomy recesses all the higher qualities of a mountaineer
may be exercised, and there is sufficient danger to give a
keen zest to their exploration. The mountain streams
sometimes plunge into a yawning chasm, locally known
as a pot, and at others emerge from the dark portals of a
cave in full current. There is, perhaps, no place in the
world where the subterranean circulation of water may
be studied with better advantage.</p>

<p>Ingleborough forms a centre from which the rainfall
on every side finds its way into the dales, through a
system of caves more or less complicated, which during
the last forty years have been thoroughly explored by
Mr. Farrer, Mr. Birkbeck, and Mr. Metcalfe. On the
south it collects in a ravine, and then leaps into a deep
bottle-shaped hole called “Gaping Gill,” into which Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Birkbeck unsuccessfully attempted to descend, the sharp
edges of the rock cutting the rope, and very nearly
causing a serious accident. In depth it is about three
hundred feet. The stream thence finds its way through
a series of chambers and passages until it reappears in the
famous Ingleborough cave, that was explored by Mr.
Farrer in the year 1837, and proved to pass into the
rock between seven and eight hundred yards.</p>

<p>The present entrance of the Ingleborough cave<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> is dry,
except after heavy rains, when the current reverts to its
old passage. The following admirable account of the
interior is given by Professor Phillips:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>“From Mr. Farrer’s plan and description, as given in
the ‘Proceedings of the Geological Society,’ June 14,
1848, and from information obligingly communicated to
me, a clear notion of the history of this most instructive
spar grotto may be formed. For about eighty yards
from the entrance the cave has been known immemorially.
At this point Josiah Harrison, a gardener in
Mr. Farrer’s service, broke through a stalagmitical barrier
which the water had formed, and obtained access to a
series of expanded cavities and contracted passages,
stretching first to the N., then to the N.W.; afterwards
to the N. and N.E., and finally to the E., till after two
years spent in the interesting toil of discovery, at a
distance of 702 yards from the mouth, the explorers
rested from their labours in a large and lofty irregular
grotto, in which they heard the sound of water falling
in a still more advanced subterranean recess. It has
been ascertained, at no inconsiderable personal risk, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
this water falls into a deep pool or linn at a lower level,
beyond which further progress appears to be impracticable.
In fact Mr. Farrer explored this dark lake by
swimming&mdash;a candle in his cap and a rope round his
body.</p>

<p>“In this long and winding gallery, fashioned by
nature in the marble heart of the mountain, floor, roof,
and sides are everywhere intersected by fissures which
were formed in the consolidation of the stone. To these
fissures and the water which has passed down them, we
owe the formation of the cave and its rich furniture of
stalactites. The direction of the most marked fissures
is almost invariably N.W. and S.E., and when certain
of these (which in my geological work I have called
master fissures) occur, the roof of the cave is usually
more elevated, the sides spread out right and left, and
often ribs and pendants of brilliant stalactite, placed at
regular distances, convert the rude fissure into a beautiful
aisle of primæval architecture. Below most of the
smaller fissures hang multitudes of delicate translucent
tubules, each giving passage to drops of water. Splitting
the rock above, these fissures admit, or formerly admitted,
dropping water: continued through the floor, the larger
rifts permit, or formerly permitted, water to enter or
flow out of the cave. By this passage of water, continued
for ages on ages, the original fissure was in the
first instance enlarged, through the corrosive action of
streams of acidulated water; by the withdrawal of the
streams to other fissures, a different process was called
into operation. The fissure was bathed by drops instead
of streams of water, and these drops, exposed to air
currents and evaporation, yielded up the free carbonic
acid to the air and the salt of lime to the rock. Every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
line of drip became the axis of a stalactitical pipe from
the roof; every surface bathed by thin films of liquid
became a sheet of sparry deposit. The floor grew up
under the droppings into fantastic heaps of stalagmite,
which, sometimes reaching the pipes, united roof and
floor by pillars of exquisite beauty.”</p>

<p>At the time of its exploration, the water stood at a
considerably higher level inside than at the present time,
and formed deep pools. The barrier of dripstone has been
cut through, and the water level lowered, and a passage
made for a considerable distance. Inside, the old water
line, which separated the subaërial from the subaqueous
dripstone, is very distinct, the former being deposited in
thick bosses, crumpled curtains, drops, straws, pyramids,
and other fantastic drip-structures, while the latter is
honeycombed, and composed of rounded, grape-like
masses. Between them an ice-like coating of stalagmite
forms a dividing line, now supported in mid air, but
that formerly shot across the surface of the pools that
have been drained, or rested on the mud and stones
which had been brought down by the stream in ancient
times. In some places it still rests on the surface of the
pools.</p>

<p>A stalactitic curtain on the right-hand side presents a
very singular appearance, its surface being covered with
an abundant crop of tiny club-like bodies about one-tenth
of an inch in length, and consisting each of a shining
drop of water, enclosing a minute fungus. These may
possibly explain in some degree the peculiar fungoid-appearance
of certain small bosses of dripstone which
I have met with in the caves of Pembrokeshire: for an
accumulation of carbonate of lime on such a nucleus
would produce the forms which they assume (see <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
There are also magnificent groups of dripstone, and
each joint in the rock is adorned with lines, and pipes,
and fringes of calc spar, or widened out into roof-shaped
hollows, and traversed by deep, vertical grooves, caused
by the passage of water laden with carbonic acid. The
general surface of the roof, where the rock is bare, has
had its fossils etched out by the acidulated water. In
one place you may stand under a branching coral, with
its sides and base distinctly marked, and in another fossil
shells stand out almost in their original beauty.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_21"><i>Rate of the Accumulation of Stalagmite.</i></h3>

<p>The rate at which the calcareous matter is being
deposited at the present time is very easy to be
estimated, for that accumulated since the passage was
cleared out is white, and contrasts with the dirty, grey-red
colour of the older kind. In one case a thickness of
0·24 had been formed in thirty-five years, by the water
flowing down the side of the passage excavated by Mr.
Farrer, while in another, in about the same time, 0·05
inch had been formed. This would give an annual
accumulation of 0·0068 in the one case, and in the other
about one-fifth of that amount. This rate does not
agree with the rate of increase noted by Mr. Farrer and
Professor Phillips in the case of a large stalagmite called
the Jockey Cap, on which a line of drops is continually
falling from one point in the roof. Its circumference
in 1839 measured 118 inches, in 1845, 120 inches,
and in 1873, I found it to be 128 inches. The annual
rate of increase from 1845 to 1873 is ·2941 inch,
and that from 1839 to 1845 is ·2857. I found,
however, that the most remarkable increase was that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
in height. In 1845 its apex was 95·25 inches from
the roof, in 1873, 87 inches, which would imply an
annual deposit of not less than ·2946. (See <a href="#APPENDIX_II">Appendix II</a>.)
At this rate it will arrive at the roof in about 295 years.
But even this comparatively short lapse of time will
probably be diminished by the growth of a pendant
stalactite above, that is now being formed in place of
that which measured 10 inches in 1845, and has since
been accidentally destroyed.</p>

<p>It is very possible that the Jockey Cap may be the
result, not of the continuous, but of the intermittent
drip of water containing carbonate of lime, and that
therefore the present rate of growth is not a measure of
its past or future condition. Its age in 1845 was estimated
by Professor Phillips at 259 years, on the supposition
that all or nearly all of the carbonate of lime in
each pint was deposited. If, however, it grew at its
present rate, it may be not more than 100 years old;
and if it be taken as a measure of the rate generally,
all the stalagmites and stalactites in the cave may not
date further back than the time of Edward III.</p>

<p>It is evident, from this instance of rapid accumulation,
that the value of a layer of stalagmite in measuring
the antiquity of deposits below it, is comparatively
little. The layers, for instance, in Kent’s Hole, which
are generally believed to have demanded a considerable
lapse of time, may possibly have been formed at the rate
of a quarter of an inch per annum, and the human bones
which lie buried under the stalagmite in the cave of
Bruniquel, are not for that reason to be taken to be of
vast antiquity. It may be fairly concluded, that the
thickness of layers of stalagmite cannot be used as an
argument in support of the remote age of the strata<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
below. At the rate of a quarter of an inch per annum,
twenty feet of stalagmite might be formed in 1,000
years.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_22"><i>The Descent into Helln Pot.</i></h3>

<p>The subterranean passages grouped round Helln Pot,
a tremendous chasm near Selside, on the east of Simon’s
Fell in Ribblesdale, illustrate in a remarkable degree
the mode in which the water is at present wearing away
the rock. Those which
have been explored constitute
the Long Churn
Cavern, which is comparatively
easy of access
through a hole known as
Diccan Pot (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, <i>a</i>).
On descending into it, the
visitor finds himself in
the bed of a stream that
now roars in a waterfall,
now gurgles over the
large fallen blocks from
the roof, and that here
and there has worn for
itself deep pools by the mechanical friction of the sand
and pebbles brought down by the current. If it be
followed down after passing over a waterfall, the light of
day is seen streaming upwards beneath the feet from the
point where the water leaps into the great chasm of
Helln Pot (<a href="#Fig_2">Figs. 2</a>, <i>b</i>. 3, <i>a</i>). Above the entrance there
is a complicated network of passages, some dry, and
some containing streams which have not yet been
fully explored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
The two actions by which caves are hewn out of the
calcareous rock are seen here in operation side by side.
Below the level of the stream the rock is seen to be
smoothed and polished by the mechanical action of the
materials swept down by the current. Above the water-level
the sides of the cave are honeycombed and eaten
into the most fantastic and complex shapes, the resultant
surface (see <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>) bearing small points and keen
knife-edges of stone, that stand out in relief and mark
the less soluble portions of the rock. This is due to the
chemical effect of the carbonic acid in the water percolating
through the strata.</p>

a hundred feet long by thirty feet wide, that engulfs the
waters of a little stream on the surface, which are dissipated
in spray long before they reach the bottom. From
the top you look down on a series of ledges, green with
ferns and mosses, and, about a hundred feet from the
surface, an enormous fragment of rock forms a natural
bridge across the chasm from one ledge to another. A little
above this is the debouchement of the stream flowing
through the Long Churn Cave (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>, <i>a</i>), through which
Mr. Birkbeck and Mr. Metcalfe made the first perilous
descent in 1847. The party, consisting of ten persons,
ventured into this awful chasm with no other apparatus
than ropes, planks, a turn-tree, and a fire-escape belt.
On emerging from the Long Churn Cave they stood on
a ledge of rock about twelve feet wide, and which gave
them free access to the “bridge” (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, <i>b</i>). This was
a rock ten feet long, which rested obliquely on the ledges.
Having crossed over this, they crept behind the waterfall
which descended from the top, and fixed their pulley,
five being let down while the rest of the party remained
behind to hoist them up again. In this way they reached
the bottom of the pot, which before had never been trod
by the foot of man. Thence they followed the stream
downwards as far as the first great waterfall, down which
Mr. Metcalfe was venturesome enough to let himself
with a rope, and to push onwards until daylight failed.
He was within a very little of arriving at the end of
the cave into which the stream flows, but was obliged
to turn back to the daylight without having accomplished
his purpose. The whole party eventually, after
considerable danger and trouble, returned safely from
this most bold adventure.</p>

<p>A second descent was made in 1848 from the surface,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
and a third in the spring of 1870, in both of which
Mr. Birkbeck took the lead. The apparatus employed
consisted of a windlass (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>), supported on two
baulks of timber, and a bucket, covered with a shield,
sufficiently large to hold two people, and two guiding
ropes to prevent the revolution of the bucket in mid
air. There was also a party of navvies to look after
the mechanical contrivances, and two ladders about
eight feet long to provide for contingencies at the
bottom. Thirteen of us went down, including three
ladies. As we descended, the fissure gradually narrowed,
until at the bottom it was not more than ten feet wide.
The actual vertical descent was a hundred and ninety-eight
feet. After running the gauntlet of the waterfall
we landed in the bed of the stream, which hurried
downwards over large boulders of limestone and lost
itself in the darkness of a large cave, about seventy
feet high. We traced it downwards, through pools and
rapids to the first waterfall, of about twenty feet. This
obstacle prevented most of the party going further, for
the ladders were too short to reach to the bottom. By
lashing them together, however, and letting them down,
we were able to reach the first round with the aid of
a rope, and to cross over the deep pool at the bottom.
Thence we went on downwards through smaller waterfalls
and rapids, until we arrived at a descent into a
chamber, where the roar of water was deafening. Down
to this point the daylight glimmered feebly, but here our
torches made but little impression on the darkness. One
of the party volunteered to go down with a rope, and
was suddenly immersed in a deep pool; the rest,
profiting by his misadventure, managed to cling on to
small points of rock, and eventually to reach the floor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
of the chamber. We stood at last on the lowest
accessible point of the cave, about 300 feet from the
surface. It was indeed one of the most remarkable
sights that could possibly be imagined. Besides the
waterfall down which we came, a powerful stream poured
out of a cave too high up for the torches to penetrate
the darkness, and fell into a deep pool in the middle of
the floor, causing such a powerful current of air that all
our torches were blown out except one. The two streams
eventually united and disappeared in a small black
circling pool, which completely barred further ingress.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Diagram of Helln Pot, showing Waterfall at the Bottom.</div></div>

<p>The floor of the pot and the cave was strewn with
masses of limestone rounded by the action of the
streams; and the water-channels were smoothed and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
grooved and polished, in a most extraordinary way, by
the silt and stones carried along by the current. Some
of the layers of limestone were jet black, and others
were of a light fawn-colour, and as the strata were
nearly horizontal, the alternation of colours gave a
peculiarly striking effect to the walls. Beneath each
waterfall was a pool more or less deep, and here and
there in the bed of the stream were holes, drilled in the
rock by stones whirled round by the force of the water.
High up, out of the present reach of the water, were old
channels, which had evidently been watercourses before
the pot and cave had been cut down to their present
level. In the sides of the pot there are two vertical
grooves reaching very nearly from the top to the bottom,
which are unmistakeably the work of ancient waterfalls.
There was no stalactite, but everywhere the water was
wearing away the rock and enlarging the cave. We
found our way back without any difficulty, a small
passage on the right-hand side enabling us to avoid the
very unpleasant task of scrambling up two of the waterfalls.
We arrived finally at the top, after about five
hours’ work in the cave, wet to the skin.</p>

<p>We had very little trouble in making this descent,
because of the completeness of Mr. Birkbeck’s preparations;
but we could fully realize what a dangerous feat
the first explorers performed when they ventured into
an unknown chasm, comparatively unprepared. The
very name “Helln Pot,” = Ællan Pot, or Mouth of Hell,
testifies to the awe with which the Angles looked down
into its recesses.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>Such is the interior of one of those great natural
laboratories in which water is wearing away the solid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
rock, either hollowing it into caves or cutting it into
ravines. At the bottom of Helln Pot it was impossible
not to realize, that the enormous chasm had been
formed by the same action as that by which it was
being deepened before our eyes. It was merely a
portion of the vast cave into which it led, which
had been deprived of its roof, and opened out to
the light of heaven. The bridge was but a fragment
of the roof which happened to fall upon the two ledges.
The rounded masses of rock at the bottom are fragments
that have fallen probably within comparatively modern
times. The absence of stalactites and of stalagmites
proves that the destructive action is rapidly going on.</p>

<p>The water-course at the bottom contained pebbles and
boulders of limestone, and gritstone rounded by friction
against one another and the rocky floor. The gritstone
has probably been derived from the wreck of the boulder
clay on the surface above the Helln Pot, and ultimately
torn from the millstone grit of the higher hills in the
district.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Waterfall in Pot-hole at Weathercote.</div></div>

<p>On the north side of Ingleborough the series of
caves and pots round the little Church of Chapel-en-le-Dale
are especially worthy of attention. The chasm at
Weathercote opens suddenly in the hill-side, and is
perfectly accessible to visitors. You come suddenly
upon a cleft a hundred feet deep, with its ledges covered
with mosses, ferns, and brambles; at one end a
body of water rushes from a cave, and under a great
bridge of rock, and falls seventy-five feet, a mass of
snow-white foam filling the bottom with spray (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>).
The large masses of rock piled in wild confusion at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
bottom, the dark shadows of the overhanging ledges,
and the thick covering of green moss, to which the
spray clings in tiny glittering drops, form a picture
which cannot easily be forgotten. In the sunshine an
almost circular rainbow is to be seen from the bottom.
The stream passes from the bottom into a cave, and
thence downwards to two large pots (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>), about two
hundred yards away. In flood-time the channel has
been known to become blocked up, and Weathercote has
been filled to the brim. Usually after heavy rains the current
is said to flow so violently into the first of the pot-holes,
that it throws up stones at least thirty or forty feet
from the bottom, with a peculiar rattling noise. From
this strange phenomenon it is known as Jingle Pot, while
the lower of the two is termed Hurtle Pot, because in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
flood-time the water whirls so fast round, that it is
“hurtled” out at the top. The water flowing through
Weathercote is derived from the
little stream of Ellerbeck, which
disappears in the limestone hills
about a mile to the north, and runs
at right angles to Dalebeck, or the
stream flowing down to Ingleton,
which it has been proved to join
at a spot below Jingle Pot, by
Mr. Metcalfe, who made his way
down into it from the chasm of
Weathercote.</p>

<div id="Fig_6" class="figcenter" style="width: 914px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Diagram of Subterranean Course of Dalebeck.</div></div>

<p>The course of Dalebeck, as you
pass up the valley of Chapel-en-le-Dale,
affords a striking instance of
the dependence of scenery upon
the nature of the rock. In its lower
portion it has cut out for itself a
deep ravine in the hard Silurian
strata, in which you come upon
the waterfalls, deep pools, and trees,
that look as if they had been transported
bodily from the district of
Cader Idris, and inserted into the
limestone scenery of the dales.
The Silurian rocks are very much
contorted, and on their waterworn
edges lie the nearly horizontal limestone
strata, in which the upper
part of the valley has been scooped.
As we rise the ravine opens into
a valley (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>), along which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
beck flows, until suddenly it is lost in a fissure, at a place
called Godsbridge. Its subterranean course is marked,
first of all, by a small depression known as Sandpot, and
still higher by Hurtle Pot. It ultimately reappears at
the surface, above Weathercote, and after passing through
a picturesque cavern, known as the Gatekirk, its fountainhead
is reached. The subterranean portions of its course
are in the same right line as the open valley, and the
pot-holes have been formed in the same manner as
Helln Pot, by the passage of water at a time when the
drainage found its way down the valley at a higher
level than at present, very much as it does now in times
of extraordinary floods.</p>

<p>Water-caves such as these are by no means uncommon
in Yorkshire. In the dales there is scarcely a mass of
limestone without its subterranean water system, as well
as channels deserted by water, which are now dry caves
situated at higher levels. These are always arranged on
the line of the natural drainage, and generally open on
the sides of the valleys and precipices. If you look
northward from the flat crown of Ingleborough, you can
see the ravines which radiate from it on the surface of
the shale below, abruptly ending in pot-holes when they
reach the limestone. In each case the streams reappear,
issuing out of the caves at the points in Chapel-en-le-Dale,
where the horizontal beds of limestone rest on the
upturned edges of the impermeable Silurian rocks.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_24"><i>The Formation of Caves and their Relation to Pot-holes
and Ravines.</i></h3>

<p>The general conditions under which caves occur in
limestone rocks, and the phenomena which they present,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
may be gathered from the above examples. Universally
the pot-holes, ravines, and caverns are so associated
together, that there can be but little doubt that they are
due to the operation of the same causes.</p>

<p>It requires but a cursory glance to see at once that
running water was the main agent. The limestone is so
traversed by joints and lines of shrinkage, that the
water rapidly sinks down into its mass, and collects in
small streams, which owe their direction to the dip of
the strata and the position of the fissures. These
channels are being continually deepened and widened
by the mere mechanical action of the passage of stones
and silt. But this is not the only way in which the
rock is gradually eroded. The limestone is composed in
great part of pure carbonate of lime, which is insoluble
in water. It is, however, readily dissolved in any liquid
containing carbonic acid, which is an essential part of
our atmosphere, is invariably present in the rain-water,
and is given off by all organic bodies. By this invisible
agent the hard crystalline rock is always being
attacked in some form or another. The very snails that
take refuge in its crannies leave an enduring mark of their
presence in a surface fretted with their acid exhalations,
which sometimes pass current among geologists for the
borings of pholades, and are the innocent cause of much
speculation as to the depression of the mountain-tops
beneath the sea in comparatively modern times. The
carbonic acid taken up by the rain is derived, in the
main, from the decomposing vegetable matter which
generally forms the surface soil on the limestone.</p>

<div id="Fig_7" class="figleft up1" style="width: 90px;">
  <img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="90" height="226" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Diagram of an acid-worn joint, Doveholes, Derbyshire.</div></div>

<p>The view from the ancient camp on the top of Ingleborough
offers a striking example of the effect of rain-water
in eroding the surface of the limestone. As you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
look down over the dark crags of millstone grit, great,
grey, pavement-like masses of limestone strike the eye,
standing above the heather, perfectly bare, and in the
distance resembling clearings, and in rainy weather
sheets of snow. On approaching them the surface of
erosion becomes more and more apparent, and the shapes
due to the mere accident of varying hardness in the rock,
or the varying quantity of water passing over it, present
a most astonishing variety. There are, however, general
principles underlying the confusion. The lines of joints
in the strata being lines of weakness, searched out by
the acid-laden water, have been widened into chasms,
sometimes of considerable depth; and as they cross
at right angles, the whole surface is formed of rectangular
masses, each insulated from its fellow, and some of
them detached from the strata beneath so as to form
rocking-stones. The mode in which the acid
has attacked one of these joints in the limestone
of Doveholes in Derbyshire is represented
in <a href="#Fig_7">Figure 7</a>, the surface being honeycombed
and worn into sharp points, solely by
chemical action. The minute fossil-shells also,
and fragments of crinoid standing out in bold
relief, lead to the same conclusion&mdash;that the
denuding agent is chemical and not mechanical.
Each of the upper surfaces of the blocks
is traversed by small depressions, which are
valley systems in miniature, in which the tiny
valleys converge into a main trunk leading
into the nearest chasm. There are also tiny caves and
hollows, that are sometimes mistaken for borings made by
pholas. In the chasms the vegetation is most luxuriant,
and the dark green fronds of harts-tongue, the delicate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Lady-fern, and the graceful <i class="taxonomy">Asplenium nigrum</i>, grow
with a rare luxuriance.</p>

<p>In these pavements every feature of limestone scenery
is represented on a minute scale. There are the valley
systems on the surface, determined by the direction of
the drainage; the long chasms represent the open valleys
and ravines, and the caves and hollows, for the most
part, run in the line of the joints.</p>

<p>The carbonic acid has left precisely the same kind of
proof of its work within the caves as we find above-ground;
and it would necessarily follow, that to it, as
well as to the mechanical power of the waters flowing
through them, their formation and enlargement
must be due, as Professor Phillips has pointed out in
his “Rivers, Mountains, and Sea Coast of Yorkshire,”
pp. 30&ndash;1.</p>

<p>From the preceding pages it will be seen that caves
in calcareous rocks are merely passages hollowed out
by water, which has sought out the lines of weakness,
or the joints formed by the shrinkage of the strata
during their consolidation. The work of the carbonic
acid is proved, not merely by the acid-worn surfaces of
the interior of the caves, but also by the large quantity
of carbonate of lime which is carried away by the water
in solution. That, on the other hand, of the mechanical
friction of the stones and sand against the sides and
bottom of the water-courses, is sufficiently demonstrated
by their grooved, scratched, and polished surfaces, and
by the sand, silt, and gravel carried along by the
currents. The generally received hypothesis, that they
have been the result of a subterranean convulsion, is
disproved by the floor and roof being formed, in very
nearly every case, of solid rock; for it would be unreasonable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
to hold that any subterranean force could act
from below, in such a manner as to hollow out the
complicated and branching passages, at different levels,
without affecting the whole mass of the rock. Nor is
there cause for holding the view put forth by M. Desnoyers<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
or M. Dupont,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> that they are the result of the
passage of hydrothermal waters. The causes at present
at work, operating through long periods of time, offer a
reasonable explanation of their existence in every limestone
district; and those which are no longer watercourses
can generally be proved to have been formerly traversed
by running water, by the silt, sand, and rounded pebbles
which they contain. In their case, either the drainage
of the district has been changed by the upheaval or
depression of the rock, or the streams have searched out
for themselves a passage at a lower level.</p>

<p>But if caves have been thus excavated, it is obvious
that ravines and valleys in limestone districts are due
to the operation of the same causes. If, for instance,
we refer to <a href="#Fig_1">Figures 1</a> and <a href="#Fig_6">6</a>, we shall see that the open
valley passes insensibly into a ravine, and that into a
cave. The ravine is merely a cave which has lost its
roof, and the valley is merely the result of the weathering
of the sides of the ravine. There can be no manner
of doubt but that, in both these cases, the ravine is
gradually encroaching on the cave, and the valley on
the ravine; and if the strata be exposed to atmospheric
agencies long enough, the valley of the Axe will extend
as far as Priddy (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>), and that of Dalebeck to the
watershed above the Gatekirk cave (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
In the same manner the lofty precipice of Malham
Cove, near Settle, in Yorkshire (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>), is slowly falling
away and uncovering the subterranean course of the
Aire. Eventually the ravine thus formed will extend as
far as Malham Tarn, and the Aire flow exposed to the
light of day from its source to the sea.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<div id="Fig_8" class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Diagram of Source of the Aire at Malham.</div></div>

<p>This view is applicable to many if not to all ravines
and valleys in calcareous rocks, such as the Pass at
Cheddar, or the gorge of the Avon at Clifton, and those
of Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and Wales. And since the
agents by which the work is done are universal, and
calcareous rock for the most part of the same chemical
composition, the results are the same, and the calcareous
scenery everywhere of the same type. In the lapse of
past time, so enormous as to be incapable of being grasped
by the human intellect, these agents are fully capable
of producing the deepest ravines, the widest valleys,
and the largest caves.</p>

<p>This view of the relation of caves to ravines was so
strongly held by M. Desnoyers, that he terms the latter
“cavernes à ciel ouvert.” I arrived independently at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the same conclusion after the study of the scenery of
limestone for many years.</p>

<p>In many cases, however, in northern latitudes and in
high altitudes, the ravine or valley so formed has been
subsequently widened and deepened by glacial action.
That, for instance, of Chapel-en-le-Dale bears unmistakeable
evidence of the former flow of a glacier, in the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roches moutonnées</i> and travelled blocks that it contains.
To this is due the flowing contour and even slope of its
lower portion.</p>

<p>The pot-holes and “cirques” in calcareous rocks with
no outlet at the surface, may also be accounted for by the
operation of the same causes as those which have produced
caves. Each represents the weak point towards
which the rainfall has converged, caused very generally
by the intersection of the joints. This has gradually
been widened out, because the upper portions of the rock
would be the first to seize the atoms of carbonic acid,
and thus be dissolved more quickly than the lower
portions. Hence the funnel shape which they generally
assume, and which can be studied equally in the
compact limestone or in the soft upper chalk. They
are to be seen on a small scale also in all limestone
“pavements.” Sometimes, however, the first chance
which the upper portions of the funnels have of being
eroded by the acidulated water, is more than counter-balanced
by the increased quantity converging at the
bottom, and the funnel ends in a vertical shaft. If the
area in the rock thus excavated be sufficiently large to
allow of the development of a current of water, the
mechanical action of the fragments swept along its course
will have an important share in the work, as we have
seen to be the case in Helln Pot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_25"><i>Caves not generally found in Line of Faults.</i></h3>

<p>In some few cases the lines of weakness which have
been worn into caves, pot-holes, ravines, and valleys,
may have been produced, as M. Desnoyers believes,
by subterranean movements of elevation and depression;
but in all those which I have investigated the faults
do not determine the direction of the caverns. The
mountain limestone of Castleton, in Derbyshire, offers
an example of caves intersecting faults without any definite
relation being traceable between them. The ramifications
of the Peak cavern traverse the Speedwell Mine
nearly at right angles, and the water flowing through
it has been traced, Mr. Pennington informs me, to a
swallow-hole near Chapel-en-le-Frith, running across two,
if not three faults, which are laid down in the geological
map. As a general rule caverns are as little affected
by disturbance of the rock as ravines and valleys which
have been formed in the main irrespective of the lines
of fault.</p>

<p>M. Desnoyers points out the close analogy between
caverns and mineral veins, and infers that both are due
to the same causes. This, undoubtedly, exists in that
class of veins which are known to miners as “pipe”
and “flat veins;” and there is clear proof, in the
majority of cases, that the cavities in which the minerals
occur have been formed by the action of running water,
and have subsequently been more or less filled with
their mineral contents; and these have been deposited
on the sides of the cavity by the same “incretionary<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
action, as that by which dripstone is now being formed
in the present caves from the solution of carbonate of lime.
Such veins present every conceivable form of irregularity,
and frequently contain silt, sand, and gravel,
which have been left behind by their streams, and their
history is identical with that of the caverns.</p>

<p>It is not so, however, with the second class of veins, the
“rake,” “right running,” and “cross courses,” as the
miners term them, or those which occupy lines of fault.
The fissures which contain the ore are proved very frequently,
by their scratched and grooved sides, and polished
surfaces or slicken-sides, to have been the result of subterranean
movements by which the rock has been broken
by mechanical force. They have been subsequently
modified, in various ways, by the passage of water, and
filled with minerals, in the same manner as the preceding
class. With this exception they present no analogy
to the caverns, with which they contrast strongly in their
rectilinear direction, as well as in their purely mechanical
origin.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_26"><i>The various Ages of Caves.</i></h3>

<p>It is very probable that caves were formed in calcareous
rocks from the time that they were raised to the
level of the sea, since they abound in the Coral Islands.
“Caverns,” writes Prof. Dana,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> “are still more remarkable
on the Island of Atiu, on which the coral-reef<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
stands at about the same height above the sea as on
Oahu. The Rev. John Williams states&mdash;that there are
seven or eight of large extent on the Island of Tuto;
one he entered by a descent of twenty feet, and wandered
a mile in one only of its branches, without finding an
end to ‘its interminable windings.’ He says&mdash;‘Innumerable
openings presented themselves on all sides as
we passed along, many of which appeared to be equal
in height, beauty, and extent to the one we were following.
The roof, a stratum of coral-rock fifteen feet thick,
was supported by massy and superb stalactitic columns,
besides being thickly hung with stalactites from an inch
to many feet in length. Some of these pendants were just
ready to unite themselves to the floor, or to a stalagmitic
column rising from it. Many chambers were passed
through whose fret-work ceilings and columns of stalactites
sparkled brilliantly, amid the darkness, with the
reflected light of our torches. The effect was produced
not so much by single objects, or groups of them, as by
the amplitude, the depth, and the complications of this
subterranean world.’”</p>

<p>Calcareous rocks might, therefore, be expected to contain
fissures and caves of various ages. In the Mendip
Hills they have been proved by Mr. Charles Moore to
contain fossils of Rhætic age, the characteristic dog-fishes,
<i class="taxonomy">Acrodus minimus</i>, and <i class="taxonomy">Hybodus reticulatus</i>, the elegant
sculptured Ganoid fish, <i class="taxonomy">Gryrolepis tenuistriatus</i>, and the
tiny marsupials, Microlestes and its allies. This singular
association of terrestrial with marine creatures is due to
the fact, that while that area was being slowly depressed
beneath the Rhætic and Liassic seas, the remains were
mingled together on the coast-line, and washed into the
crevices and holes in the rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
The older caves and fissures have very generally been
blocked up by accumulations of calc-spar or other minerals,
and they are arranged on a plan altogether independent
of the existing systems of drainage.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact that no fissures or caves should,
with the above exception, contain the remains of animals
of a date before the Pleistocene age. There can be but
little doubt that they were used as places of shelter in all
ages, and they must have entombed the remains of the
animals that fell into them, or were swept into them by
the streams. Caves there must have been long before, and
the Eocene Palæotheres, and Anoplotheres met their death
in the open pit-falls, just as the sheep and cattle do at
the present time. The Hyænodon of the Meiocene had,
probably, the same cave-haunting tastes as his descendant,
the living Hyæna, and the marsupials of the Mesozoic
age might be expected to be preserved in caves, like the
fossil marsupials of Australia. The chances of preservation
of the remains when once cemented into a fine
breccia, or sealed down with a crystalline covering of
stalagmite, are very nearly the same as those under
which the Pleistocene animals have been handed down
to us. The only reasonable explanation of the non-discovery
of such remains seems to be, that the ancient
suites of caves and fissures containing them, and for the
most part near the then surface of the rock, have been
completely swept away by denudation, while the present
caverns were either then not excavated or inaccessible.</p>

<p>Such an hypothesis will explain the fact that the
no ossiferous caverns are older than the Pleistocene age,
not merely in Europe, but in North and South America,
Australia, and New Zealand. The effect of denudation
in rendering the geological record imperfect, may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
gathered from the estimate, which Mr. Prestwich has
formed, of the amount of rock removed from the crests
of the Mendips and the Ardennes, which is in the one
case a thickness “of two miles and more,” and in the
other as much as “three or four miles.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Under these
conditions we could not expect to find a series of bone
caves reaching far back into the remote geological past,
since the caves and their contents would inevitably be
destroyed.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_27"><i>The Filling up of Caves.</i></h3>

<p>We must now consider the condition under which
caves become filled up with various deposits. If the
velocity of the stream in a water-cave be lessened, the
silt, sand, or pebbles it was hurrying along will be
dropped, and may ultimately block up the entire watercourse.
In bringing this to pass, however, the carbonate
of lime in the water plays a most important part. If
the excess of carbonic acid by which it is held in solution
be lost by evaporation, it immediately reassumes its
crystalline form, and shoots over the surface of the pool
like plates of ice, or is deposited in loose botryoidal
masses at their sides and on their bottoms; and, since
the atmospheric water very generally percolates through
the crannies in the rock, the sides and roof of the channel,
above the level of the water, are adorned with a
stony drapery of every conceivable shape. The rate at
which this accumulation takes place depends upon the
free access of air necessary for evaporation, and is
therefore variable,&mdash;as in the case of the Ingleborough
cave. In all the caves which I have examined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
there is a free current of air. If a water-channel becomes
blocked up by either or both these causes, the joints and
fissures in the rock offer an outlet to the drainage, more
or less free, at a lower level, as in the Ingleborough
cave, Poole’s cave, near Buxton, and many others.
Sometimes, however, owing to the increased rain-fall,
or to the obstruction of the lower channels, the water
re-excavates the old passages, as we shall see to have
been the case with the famous caverns of Kent’s Hole
and Brixham. In the summer of 1872, a sudden rain-fall
not merely opened out for itself a new passage into a
swallow-hole close to Gaping Gill, on the flanks of Ingleborough,
but forced its way out through the old entrance
of the Ingleborough cave, breaking up the calcareous
breccia, and removing the large stones in its course. A
cave obviously may become dry, either by the drainage
passing along a lower level, or by the elevation of the
district by subterranean energy. After it has been forsaken
by the stream, the particles brought down by the
atmospheric water percolating through the joints, tend
to fill it up on the surface, and these may be either of
clay, loam, or sand.</p>

<p>These actions may be studied in this country in the
well-known caves of Ingleborough, Buxton, Cheddar,
Wookey Hole, and a great many others in Derbyshire,
Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Durham, Cumberland,
and Wales.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;The Fairy Chamber, Caldy.</div></div>

<p>Among the most beautiful stalactite caverns in this
country is that on the island of Caldy, immediately
opposite to Tenby in Pembrokeshire, discovered some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
years ago in the limestone cliff, and explored by Mr.
Ayshford Sanford and the Rev. H.&nbsp;H. Winwood, in
1866, and subsequently by the writer in 1871 and
1872. On creeping through a narrow entrance with an
outlook to the sea on a precipitous side of a quarry, a
passage leads to a chamber of considerable horizontal
extent, the bottom being covered with silt, on which
stand pedestals of dripstone from an inch to two feet
in length, each rising from a thin calcareous crust
which does not altogether conceal the silt below. From
it a low entrance leads into a fairy-like chamber, the
floor consisting of a rich red, crystalline pavement, perfectly
horizontal, and studded here and there with round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
bosses (<a href="#Fig_9">Figs. 9</a>, <a href="#Fig_10">10</a>, <a href="#Fig_11">11</a>), either red or snow-white. From
the roof hang stalactites offering the same beautiful contrast
of colours, forming a delicate canopy of tassels, or
passing downwards to the floor and constituting slender
shafts about three feet long, and about the diameter of
straws. Each of these is hollow, translucent, and more
or less traversed by water, and in some places each stood
next its fellow, almost as close as the straws in a cornfield.
Sometimes the shaft stands on a cone (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>)
of dripstone, more or less raised above the floor. Small
pools of water occupy hollows in the pavement, each
lined with glittering crystals of calcite (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>), which
are slowly shooting over the surface, and converting
some of the open hollows into bottle-shaped cavities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>). Their sides and bottoms are covered with a
crystalline growth of singular beauty, of which an idea
may be formed by <a href="#Fig_14">woodcut 14</a>, which represents the
edge. Where the
drip happened to
fall into a shallow
pool, it gradually
built up for itself a cone, on the lower portion of which
the varying water-level is marked by horizontal rings of
crystals (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>), and the normal waterline
by the upper horizontal plate. Sometimes
these were united to the roof by
a slender straw-shaft. In <a href="#Fig_11">Figure 11</a> the
original shaft has been broken away, and
as the direction of the drip has slightly
shifted, a new one gradually descended, until finally it
became cemented to the side of the cone.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;Cone with Straw-column.</div></div>

<p>The history of these structures is very evident. The
straw-like stalactites were formed by the evaporation
of the carbonic acid from the surface of each drop of
water, as it accumulated in one spot, and the consequent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
deposit of carbonate of lime around its circumference.
It could not be formed in the centre, because of the
continual movement of the successive drops in falling.
By a circumferential growth of this kind a small crystal
tube, of the diameter of a drop, is slowly developed,
which continues to lengthen until the result is one of the
straw-columns, with a hole in the centre for the passage
of the water, which cannot readily part with its carbonic
acid till it arrives at the end of the tube. Sometimes
the hole has been subsequently blocked up by calc-spar,
or the general surface been covered over with successive
layers, until it becomes a mass of considerable diameter.
If the drop fell into a deep pool, the straw-column was
continued down to the water-line; if in shallow water,
or on the floor, a pedestal was built up, as is represented
in the preceding figures. The crystallization going on in
the pools is greater at the surface than below, because of
the greater evaporation, and consequently the stalagmitic
film is gradually extending over it on every side from
the edges (<a href="#Fig_12">Figs. 12</a>, <a href="#Fig_13">13</a>).</p>

<p>As I broke my way into some of the unexplored
recesses, through the thickly planted straw-shafts, and
scene after scene of fairy beauty, unsullied by man,
opened upon my eyes, the ringing of the fragments on
the crystalline floor that accompanied almost every
movement made me feel an intruder, and sorry for
the destruction.</p>

<p>In some places, where the drip was continuous, and
the calcareous basin which it had built up for itself
shallow, small spherical bodies of calcite were so beautifully
polished by friction in the agitated water, that they
deserve the name of cave-pearls from their lustre. In
<a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a> I have represented a tiny basin with its pearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
contents. Where the drip had ceased to be continuous
each of these formed a nucleus for the deposit of calcite
crystals, by which they were united to the bottom of
the basin.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>&mdash;Fungoid Structures, magnified.</div></div>

<p>In the principal chamber in the cave, which is very
nearly free from drip, the upper surfaces of the stones
and stalagmites on the floor are covered with a peculiar
fungoid-like deposit of calcite, consisting of rounded
bosses, attached to the general
surface by a pedicle
(see <a href="#Fig_17">Figs. 17</a>, <a href="#Fig_18">18</a>) sometimes
not much thicker
than a hair. They stood
close together at various
levels, following the inequalities of the surface of
attachment, and being on an average about 0·2 inch
long. Several microscopical sections (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>) showed
that each was formed originally
on a slight elevation
of the general surface, which
would cause a greater evaporation
of water than the
surrounding portions, and
therefore be covered with a
greater deposit of calcite.
This process would go on
until the height was reached
to which the water slowly passing over the general
surface would no longer rise. Hence the remarkable
uniformity of the height of the bosses. The evaporation
is greater at the point furthest removed from
the general surface, and therefore the apex is larger
than the base (see <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>). In <a href="#Fig_18">Figure 18</a> they stand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
as thickly together as trees in a virgin forest, and
are developed in greatest vigour where the small eminences
cause a greater evaporation than the small depressions,
and are stoutest and strongest at the free edges.
Some of the pedicles, as in the figure, present traces of
erosion, the outer layers having been eaten away by acid-laden
water.</p>

<p>Some of these singular little bosses may have been
moulded on minute fungi, such as those in the cave of
Ingleborough, but their presence is not revealed by the
microscope.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;Fungoid Structure, Black-rock Cave.</div></div>

<p>I met with this remarkable kind of calcareous deposition
in a second cave in the neighbourhood of Tenby.
When examining the Black-rock quarries in 1871, the
workmen pointed out a small opening which they believed
to be the entrance of a cave, but which was too
small for them to enter. By knocking off, however, a
few sharp angles, I got into a small chamber about five
feet high, with sides, roof, and bottom covered with
massive dripstone. A few
loose stones rested on the
bottom. The whole surface,
even including the
stones upon the floor, one of
which is figured (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>),
was so completely covered
with these peculiar fungoid
bodies, that it was impossible
to move without destroying hundreds of them.
All were about the same height, 0·2 inches, snow-white,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
or of a rich reddish brown, and conformed to the unequal
surface on which they stood. It is quite impossible to
describe the effect of a whole chamber bristling with
these peculiar structures. The only author by whom
they are mentioned, Mr. John Beaumont&mdash;who described
the caves of Mendip in 1680, considered them to be
veritable plants of stone.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> The beautiful forms assumed
by the dripstone in the caves of Caldy and Black-rock
are by no means uncommon, but I have never met with
them anywhere else in such perfection. They may be
studied in all stalactitic caverns.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_30"><i>Great Quantity of Carbonate of Lime dissolved by
Atmospheric Water.</i></h3>

<p>A small portion only of the carbonate of lime is deposited
as tufa or dripstone in the neighbourhood of the
rock from which it has been derived, as compared with
that carried by the streams into the rivers, and the
rivers into the sea. An idea of this quantity may be
formed from the calculation of the solid matter conveyed
down by the Thames, given by Mr. Prestwich in
his Presidential Address to the Geological Society in
1871, p. lxvii.</p>

<p>“Taking the mean daily discharge of the Thames at
Kingston at 1,250,000,000 gallons, and the salts in solution
at nineteen grains per gallon, the mean quantity of
dissolved mineral matter there carried down by the
Thames every twenty-four hours is equal to 3,364,286
lbs., or 150 tons, which is equal to 548,230 tons in the
year. Of this daily quantity about two-thirds, or say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
1,000 tons, consist of carbonate of lime and 238 tons of
sulphate of lime, while limited proportions of carbonate
of magnesia, chlorides of sodium and potassium, sulphates
of soda and potash, silica and traces of iron,
alumina, and phosphates, constitute the rest. If we
refer a small portion of the carbonates and the sulphates
and chlorides chiefly to the impermeable argillaceous
formations washed by the rain-water, we shall still have
at least ten grains per gallon of carbonate of lime, due
to the chalk, upper greensand, oolitic strata, and marlstone,
the superficial area of which, in the Thames basin
above Kingston, is estimated by Mr. Harrison at 2,072
square miles. Therefore the quantity of carbonate of
lime carried away from this area by the Thames is equal
to 797 tons daily, or 290,905 tons annually, which gives
140 tons removed yearly from each square mile; or, extending
the calculation to a century, we have a total
removal of 29,090,500 tons, or of 14,000 tons from
each square mile of surface. Taking a ton of chalk, as
a mean, as equal to fifteen cubic feet, this is equal to
the removal of 210,000 cubic feet per century for each
square mile, or of 9/100 of an inch from the whole surface
in the course of a century, so that in the course of
13,200 years a quantity equal to a thickness of about
one foot would be removed from our chalk and oolitic
districts.”</p>

<p>This destructive action, operating through long periods
of time, destroys not merely the general surface of the
limestone, but, where it is localized by the convergence
of water, is capable of excavating the deepest gorges
and the longest caves. The quantity of material carried
away in solution is a measure of the power of carbonic
acid in the general work of denudation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_31"><i>The Circulation of Carbonate of Lime.</i></h3>

<p>The circulation of carbonate of lime in nature presents
us with a never-ending cycle of change. It is
conveyed into the sea to be built up into the tissues
of the animal and vegetable inhabitants. It appears in
the gorgeous corallines, nullipores, calcareous sea-weeds,
sea-shells, and in the armour of crustaceans. In the tissues
of the coral-zoophytes it assumes the form of stony
groves, of which each tree is a colony of animals, and in
the wave-defying reef it reverts to its original state of
limestone. Or, again, it is seized upon by tiny masses of
structureless protoplasm, and fashioned into chambers of
endless variety and of infinite beauty, and accumulated
at the bottom of the deeper seas, forming a deposit analogous
to our chalk. In the revolution of ages the bottom
of the sea becomes dry land, the calcareous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i> of
animal and vegetable life is more or less compacted
together by pressure and by the infiltration of acid-laden
rain-water, and appears as limestone of various
hardness and constitution. Then the destruction begins
again, and caves, pot-holes, and ravines are again carved
out of the solid rock.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_32"><i>The Temperature of Caves.</i></h3>

<p>The air in caves is generally of the same temperature
as the mean annual temperature of the district in which
they occur, and therefore cold in summer and warm in
winter. This would be a sufficient reason why they
should be chosen by uncivilized peoples as habitations.</p>

<p>The very remarkable glacières, or caves containing ice
instead of water, in the Jura, Pyrenees, in Teneriffe, Iceland,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and other districts of high altitude and low temperature,
in which the temperature even in summer does not
rise much above freezing-point, may be explained by the
theory advanced independently by De Luc and the Rev.
G.&nbsp;F. Browne. “The heavy cold air of winter,” writes
the latter, “sinks down into the glacières, and the
lighter, warm air of summer cannot on ordinary principles
dislodge it, so that heat is very slowly spread in
the caves; and even when some amount of heat does
reach the ice, the latter melts but slowly, since a kilogramme
of ice absorbs 79° C. of heat in melting; and
thus when ice is once formed, it becomes a material
guarantee for the permanence of cold in the cave. For
this explanation to hold good it is necessary that the
level at which the ice is found should be below the level
of the entrance to the cave; otherwise the mere weight of
the cold air would cause it to leave its prison as soon as
the spring warmth arrived.” It is also necessary that the
cave should be protected from direct radiation and from
the action of wind. These conditions are satisfied by all
the glacières explored by Mr. Browne.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> The apparent
anomaly that one only out of a group of caves exposed
to the same temperatures should be a glacière, may be
explained by the fact that these conditions are found in
combination but rarely, and if one were absent there
would be no accumulation of perpetual ice. It is very
probable that the store of cold laid up in these caves,
as in an ice-house, has been ultimately derived from
the great refrigeration of climate in Europe in the
Glacial Period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_33"><i>Conclusion.</i></h3>

<p>In this chapter we have examined the physical history
of caves, their formation, and their relation to pot-holes,
cirques, and ravines; and we have seen that they are
not the result of subterranean disturbance, but of the
mechanical action of rain-water and the chemical action
of carbonic acid, both operating from above. We have
seen that cave-hunting is not merely an adventurous
amusement, but also a quest that brings us into a great
laboratory, so to speak, in which we can see the natural
agents at work that have carved out the valleys and
gorges, and shaped the hills wherever the calcareous
rocks are to be found.</p>

<p>The rest of this treatise will be devoted to the
evidence which they offer as to the former inhabitants,
both men and animals, of Europe.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_34"><i>Definition of Historic Period.</i></h3>

<p class="in0">In the preceding chapter the origin of caves has been
discussed, as well as their relation to the physical geography
of the districts in which they are found. We
must now pass on to the biological division of the subject,
which relates to the animals that they contain and
the inferences that may be drawn from their occurrence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
The caves will be divided into historic, prehistoric, and
pleistocene, according to the principles laid down in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">first</a> chapter.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to define
with precision the point where legend ends and history
begins; but the line may be drawn with convenience at
the first beginning of a connected and continuous narrative,
rather than at the first isolated notice of a country.
If we accept this definition, the historic period in Great
Britain cannot be extended further back than the temporary
invasion of Julius Cæsar, <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 55, even if so far,
since of the interval that elapsed between that event and
the subjugation under Claudius, in the year <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 43, we
know scarcely anything. Of the events which happened
in this country before Cæsar’s invasion there is no documentary
evidence, although, by the modern method of
scientific research, we are able to extend the narrative
away from the borders of history far back into the archæological
and geological past.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_35"><i>Wild Animals in Britain during the Historic Period.</i></h3>

<p>During the historic period great changes have taken
place in the animals inhabiting Great Britain. The wild
animals have been diminished in number, and their
area of occupation has been narrowed by the increase
of population and the improvement in weapons of destruction.
The brown bear, inhabiting Britain during
the time of the Roman occupation, was extirpated probably
before the tenth century. The current belief that
it was destroyed in Scotland by the founder of the
Gordon family in 1057 is unsupported by any documentary
evidence which I have been able to discover;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the crest of the Gordons, which is supposed to have been
derived from the last of those animals slain in the island,
consisting of three boars’, not <em>bears’</em>, heads. The last
wolf is said to have been destroyed in Scotland in 1680,
while in Ireland the animal lingered thirty years later to
be a terror to the defenceless beggars. It was deemed
worthy of a special decree for its destruction in the reign
of Edward I. The wild boar was extinct before the
reign of Charles I., while the beaver, which was hunted
for its fur on the banks of the Teivi in Cardiganshire
during the time of the first Crusade, became extinct
shortly afterwards. The stag was so abundant in the
south of England as recently as the reign of Queen
Anne, that she saw a herd of no less than five hundred
between London and Portsmouth. At present the animal
lives only in a half-wild condition, in the forest of Exmoor
and the Highlands of Scotland; while the roedeer
is now only found wild in Scotland, although it formerly
ranged throughout the length and breadth of the
country.</p>

<p>The reindeer is proved to have been living in Caithness
as late as the year 1159, by a passage in the
Orkneyinga Saga.</p>

<p>The common rat, <i class="taxonomy">Mus decumanus</i>, is the only wild or
semi-wild animal that has migrated into this country
during the historic period contrary to the will of man.
In 1727 it (<i class="taxonomy">Pallas, Glires</i>) had begun to invade
Southern Russia from the regions of Persia and the
Caspian Sea. Thence it swiftly spread over Asia Minor,
and while it was advancing to the west overland, it
was carried by ships to nearly all the ports in the
world. It arrived in Britain certainly before the year
1730, and has since nearly exterminated the black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
indigenous species. It is the only wild animal which
is known to have invaded Europe since the pleistocene
age, with the exception, perhaps, of the true elk.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_36"><i>Animals living under the care of Man.</i></h3>

<p>The fallow-deer, indigenous in the countries bordering
on the Mediterranean, was probably introduced by the
Romans, since its remains occur in refuse-heaps of
Roman age, such as that of London Wall, and of Colchester,
while it has not been met with in older deposits.
To them, also, we probably owe the introduction of the
pheasant, which was sufficiently abundant in the neighbourhood
of London in the time of Harold to be
mentioned as one of the articles of food eaten on feast-days
by the households of the Canons at Waltham Abbey
in 1059. The domestic fowl has left the first traces of
its presence in this country in the Roman refuse-heaps,
although it was known to the Belgæ, according to the
testimony of Cæsar, before the first Roman invasion.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the domestic cat in this
country is to be found in the laws of Howel Dha,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> that
were probably codified at the end of the tenth or in the
eleventh century, although many of the enactments may
be of a much earlier date. The king’s cat is assessed at
eightpence, or twice as much as that belonging to any
subject. The ass<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> was certainly known in Britain in the
days of Æthelred (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 866&ndash;871), when, according to Professor
Bell, its price was fixed at the large sum of twelve
shillings. The larger breed of cattle represented by the
Chillingham ox, and descended from the great Urus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
first appears in this country about the time of the English
invasion. It gradually spread over those districts
conquered by the English, until the small aboriginal
dark-coloured, short-horn <i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>, which was
the only domestic breed in the prehistoric and Roman
times, is now only to be met with in the hill country of
Wales and of Scotland, in which the Brit-Welsh or
Romano-Celtic inhabitants still survive.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_37"><i>Classificatory value of Historic Animals.</i></h3>

<p>The principal changes in the fauna of Great Britain
during the historic age are the extinction of the bear,
wolf, beaver, reindeer, and wild boar, and the introduction
of the domestic fowl, the pheasant, fallow-deer, ass,
the domestic cat, the larger breed of oxen, and the common
rat; and as this took place at different times, it is
obvious that these animals enable us to ascertain the
approximate date of the deposit in which their remains
happen to occur. And for this purpose the following

<p>Some or other of these animals are met with in the
peat-bogs and alluvia, and in caves, but far more abundantly
in the refuse-heaps left behind by man, by whom
they have here been used either for service or for food.</p>

<p>The disappearance of certain wild species, from the
areas in which they lived on the continent, in historic
times, has not been ascertained so accurately as in this
country, and many animals, which have become extinct
in our restricted and highly-cultivated island, are still
to be found in the continental forests, morasses, and
mountains. The brown bear is still to be met with in
the Pyrenees, the Vosges, and in the wilder and more
inaccessible portions of northern, middle, and southern
Europe. The wolf still survives in France, and during
the late German war preyed upon the slain after some of
the battles. It, as well as the wild boar, ranges throughout
the uncultivated regions of the continent. The beaver
still lives in the waters of the Rhone, as well as in the
rivers of Lithuania and of Scandinavia, and the reindeer,
now restricted to the regions north of a line passing
east and west through the Baltic, extended further south,
in sufficient numbers to be remarked by Cæsar, among the
more noteworthy animals living in the great Hercynian
forest, which overshadowed northern Germany in his
days. This forest also afforded shelter to the true elk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
and the bison, both of which still live in Lithuania, as
well as to the Urus, which was hunted by Charles the
Great, near Aachen, and probably became extinct in the
fifteenth or sixteenth century. The lion inhabited the
mountains of southern Thrace in the days of Herodotus
and of Aristotle, and became extinct in Europe between
330 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> and the days of Dio Chrysostom Rhetor
(<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 100), who expressly says that there were no lions
in Greece in his time. The panther also inhabited the
same district when Xenophon wrote his “Treatise on
Hunting.”</p>

<p>The fallow-deer was believed by the late Professor
Edouard Lartet to have been introduced into France by
the Romans. On a visit, however, to Paris in September
1873, Professor Gervais called my attention to an
antler of the animal in the Jardin des Plantes, said to
have been found in a refuse-heap along with axes of
polished stone. It must therefore have lived in France
in the Neolithic age, if it were obtained from an undisturbed
deposit. It gradually spread into Germany and
Switzerland, until in the eleventh century it was sufficiently
abundant to be mentioned among the articles of
food in a metrical grace of the monks of St. Gall.</p>

</div>

<p>The domestic fowl is to be recognized on Gallic coins
before the Roman invasion, and therefore was probably
known at the very dawn of Gallic history. The larger
breed of oxen, descended from the Urus type, has been
known in France, Germany, Lombardy, Scandinavia,
and Switzerland, in the remote division of the prehistoric<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
age known as the Neolithic.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> The buffalo, on
the other hand, of the Roman Campagna, was introduced
into Italy, according to Paulus Diaconus, in the year
596, and the domestic cat,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> known to the Greeks from
their intercourse with Egypt, became familiar to the
eyes of the inhabitants of Rome and Constantinople
as early as the fourth century after Christ.</p>

<p>It is evident from the survival of the wolf, the bear,
beaver, reindeer, and the wild boar on the continent at
the present time, that the chronological table which I
have constructed for Britain is inapplicable to Europe in
general. In the present state of our knowledge of the
varying ranges of the animals, it seems impossible to
form any similar scheme.</p>

<p>The historic caves are characterized by the presence
of some of these animals, as well as of coins and pottery,
and other articles by which the date of their occupation
may be ascertained.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_38"><i>The Victoria Cave, Settle, Yorkshire.</i></h3>

<p>The most important historic cave in this country is
that discovered by Mr. Joseph Jackson, near Settle, in
Yorkshire, on the coronation day of Queen Victoria, in
1838, and which has therefore been called the Victoria
Cave. It runs horizontally into the precipitous side of
a lonely ravine known as King’s Scar (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>), at a
height of about 1,450 feet above the sea, according to
Mr. Tiddeman, and it consists of three large ill-defined
chambers filled with débris nearly up to the roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<div id="Fig_19" class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
  <img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="465" height="543" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;View of King’s Scar, Settle, showing the entrances of the Victoria and
  Albert Caves (from a photograph). <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>, <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, Victoria; <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>, Albert.</div></div>

<p>The entrances face to the south-west, and open at
the bottom of an overhanging cliff at the point where
a scree, or accumulation of fragments from the cliff
above, gradually slopes down to the bottom of the
valley, about one hundred feet below. When Mr.
Jackson made his discovery, he passed inwards through
a small entrance,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> and was rewarded by finding in the
earth on the floor a number of Roman coins, together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
with ornaments and implements of bronze, and some
brooches of singular taste and beauty, with implements
of bone, and large quantities of broken bones
and fragments of pottery. The collection was very miscellaneous;
for besides iron spear-heads, nails, daggers,
spoon-brooches of bone, spindle-whorls, beads of amber
and of glass, there were bronze brooches, finger-rings,
armlets, bracelets, buckles, and studs. All were lying
pêle-mêle together, side by side with the broken bones
of the animals, and the whole set of remains, with the
exception of some of the brooches, was of the kind
which is usually met with in the neighbourhood of
Roman camps, cities, and villas which have been sacked.</p>

<p>The fragments of Samian ware and Roman pottery
scattered through the mass, as well as coins of Trajan
and Constantine, proved further, that the cave had been
inhabited after the Roman invasion, and not earlier than
the middle of the third century; and the rude imitations
of Roman coins were, according to Mr. Roach Smith,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
probably in circulation for some centuries after the
departure of the Romans from Britain.&mdash;“And although
some of these remains are indicative of sepulture, yet
from the evidence furnished there appears no positive
proof of their having formed part of funereal deposits.
A more satisfactory conclusion seems to arise in considering
that these caves (<i>i.e.</i> the group) may have been
used as places of refuge by the Romanized Britons
during the troublous times at and after the close of the
fourth century.” This conclusion we shall see fully borne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
out by the evidence subsequently obtained. Mr. Jackson
gives the following account of the <span class="locked">discovery:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The entrance was nearly filled up with rubbish, and
overgrown with nettles. After removing these obstructions,
I was obliged to lie down at full length to get in.
The first appearance that struck me on entering was
the large quantity of clay and earth, which seemed as if
washed in from without, and presented to the view
round pieces like balls of different sizes. Of this clay
there must be several hundred waggon loads, but
abounding more in the first than in the branch caves.
In some parts a stalagmitic crust has formed, mixed with
bones, broken pots, &amp;c. It was on this crust I found
the principal part of the coins, the other articles being
mostly imbedded in the clay. In the other caves very
little has been found. When we get through the clay,
which is very stiff and deep, we generally find the rock
covered with bones, all broken and presenting the
appearance of having been gnawed. The entrance into
the inner cave has been walled up at the sides. In the
inside were several large stones lying near the hole, any
one of which would have completely blocked it up by
merely turning the stone over. I pulled the wall down,
and the aperture was now about a yard wide, and two
feet high. On digging up the clay at about nine or ten
inches deep, I found the original floor; it was hard and
gravelly, and strewed with bones, broken pots, and other
objects. The roof of the cave was beautifully hung
with stalactites in various fantastic forms and as white
as snow.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>The interest in these discoveries led Mr. Denny, Mr.
Farrer, and other gentlemen to examine the superficial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
stratum from time to time, until, in 1870, Sir James
Kay-Shuttleworth, Mr. Walter Morrison, Mr. Birkbeck,
and other gentlemen in the neighbourhood formed a
committee for the investigation of the contents of the
cave, which had been placed at their disposal by the
courtesy of the owner, the late Mr. Stackhouse. They
were aided by the assistance of Sir C. Lyell, Sir. J.
Lubbock, and Mr. Darwin, Professor Phillips, Mr.
Franks, and others, and by a grant obtained from the
British Association, and have carried on the work since
that time with comparatively little interruption. Mr.
Jackson, the original discoverer, superintended the
workmen; while I identified the works of art and the
mammalian remains that were discovered, and drew up
for the committee the reports brought before the British
Association in 1870, 1871, and 1872, and before the
Anthropological Institute in 1871. Mr. Tiddeman also
contributed a report on the physical history of the cave,
which is printed in the British Association Report for
1872, and subsequently in the Geological Magazine,
January 1873.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span><a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;Longitudinal Section of Victoria Cave.</div></div>

<p>The committee resolved not to begin at the entrance
which Mr. Jackson discovered in 1838 (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a> <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>), but
to make a new passage, at a point where daylight could
be seen through the chinks of the broken débris, which
there prevented access. Ground was broken on a small
plateau in front of this (<a href="#Fig_19">Figs. 19</a> <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, <a href="#Fig_20">20</a>), which, from the
sunny aspect and commanding view, would naturally be
chosen by the dwellers in the cave as their more usual
place for eating and lounging, and in which we might
therefore expect to find the remains of whatever they
had dropped or lost. The gloomy recesses of a cave,
indeed, even if lit up by large fires or by torches, are
not fitted for any other purpose than for sleeping or
concealment; and if we add in this case the damp cold
clay under foot and the constant drip of the water overhead,
it was only reasonable to infer that most of their
life was spent out of doors, and that the cave was used
merely as a place of retirement for shelter. As the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
trench progressed we dug first of all through a thickness
of two feet (<a href="#Fig_20">Figs. 20</a>, <a href="#Fig_21">21</a>) of angular blocks of limestone,
that had fallen from the cliff above, and that rested on
a black layer (No. 4) containing the kind of remains
which we had expected. The layer was composed of
fragments of bone and charcoal, surrounding the burnt
stones which had formed the ancient hearths, and contained
large quantities of the broken bones of animals
which had been used for food, and coins and articles of
luxury, as well as those instruments which were more
naturally suited for the half-savage life of dwellers in
caves. As we opened out the new mouth, the angular
fragments disappeared and the black layer rose to the
surface, composing the floor, and lying in some places
beneath enormous blocks of limestone which had fallen
from the roof since its accumulation, and being continuous
with the layer in which Mr. Jackson first made
his discoveries.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;Vertical Section at the Entrance to the Victoria Cave.</div></div>

<p>It was evident that this stratum had been formed
during the sojourn of man in the cave, and we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
find, in the examination of the remains which it furnished,
proof that it is connected with the obscure history of
Britain during the fifth and sixth centuries. We will
take each group of objects in its proper class, beginning
with what at first sight seems the least promising, the
broken bones of the animals that supplied the inhabitants
with food.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_40"><i>The Bones of the Animals.</i></h3>

<p>The bones of the Celtic short-horn (<i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>)
were very abundant, and proved that a variety of ox,
indistinguishable from the small dark mountain cattle of
Wales and Scotland, was the chief food of the inhabitants.
A variety of the goat with simple recurved
horns, which is commonly met with in the Yorkshire
tumuli explored by Canon Greenwell, and in the deposits
round Roman villas in Great Britain, furnished the
mutton; while the pork was supplied by a domestic
breed of pigs with small canines; and since the bones
of the last animal belong for the most part to young
individuals, it is clear that the young porker was
preferred to the older animal. The bill of fare was
occasionally varied by the use of horse-flesh, which
formed a common article of food in this country down
to the ninth century. To this list must be added the
venison of the roedeer and stag, but the remains of these
two animals were singularly rare. Two spurs of the
domestic fowl, and a few bones of wild duck and grouse,
complete the list of animals which can with certainty
be affirmed to have been eaten by the dwellers in
the cave. The numerous unbroken bones, some very
gigantic, of the badger, and those of the fox, wildcat,
hare, and water-vole, commonly called water-rat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
have probably been introduced subsequently, from
those animals having used the cave as a place of shelter.
There were also bones of the dog, which from their
unbroken condition proved that the animal had not
been used for food, as it certainly was used by the
men who lived in the caves of Denbighshire in the
Neolithic age. The whole group of remains implies
that the dwellers in the Victoria Cave lived upon
their flocks and herds, rather than by the chase.
And since the domestic fowl was not known in
Britain until about the time of the Roman invasion, the
presence of its remains fixes the date of the occupation
as not earlier than that time. On the other hand, since
the small Celtic short-horn (<i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>) was the only
domestic ox in use known in Roman Britain, and since
it disappeared from those portions of the country which
were conquered by the English, along with its Celtic
possessors, the date is fixed in the other direction as being
not much later than the Northumbrian conquest of that
portion of Yorkshire. I shall return to this part of
the subject presently; here I will only remark, that
the present distribution of the lineal descendants of the
Celtic short-horn, the small, dark-coloured Scotch and
Welsh cattle, corresponds with those regions on which
the Celtic population fell back before the English. And
its survival in Wales, and until comparatively recently in
Cornwall, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, may be
accounted for by the fact, that in those districts the
Celtic populations of Roman Britain were not displaced
by the English invaders.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>The larger breed of cattle known in its purity as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
white ox of Chillingham, from which all our purely
English breeds have been derived, was imported originally
by the English, and spread over the whole country
which they occupied, until at last the smaller and more
ancient oxen survived only in a few isolated areas in the
north and west of Britain. This displacement of the
Celtic short-horn by the English oxen of the Urus type
corroborates, in a striking degree, the truth of Mr.
Freeman’s view of the ruthless destruction of everything
Roman and Celtic at the hands of the English. It is
clear, therefore, that from the examination of the bones
we may infer that the cave was occupied before the
Celtic short-horn was supplanted in this district by
the larger domestic breed of oxen, and after the introduction
of the domestic fowl, that is to say, in the
interval which elapsed between the Roman and English
invasions.</p>

<p>We must now treat of the remains of man’s handiwork
in the cave.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_41"><i>Miscellaneous Articles.</i></h3>

<div id="Fig_22" class="figright up2" style="width: 107px;">
  <img src="images/i_091.jpg" width="107" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Spoon-brooch (natural size).</div></div>

<p>The ornaments and implements of bone consist of
carefully smoothed pins, and points intended to be fitted
to a handle, knife-handles made of bone and antler;
three spindle-whorls made of the perforated head of a
femur; a stud; a perfect spoon-shaped fibula (<a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>),
which corresponds with one of those in the Museum of
the Royal Irish Academy, as well as several fragments,
and which when in use was passed through holes in
the clothes, in such a manner that the two ends alone
were visible. These are ornamented, and the shaft
and the whole back is more or less polished by wear.
Eight articles bear a close resemblance to the handles
of gimlets (<a href="#Fig_23">Figs. 23</a>, <a href="#Fig_24">24</a>), and most probably have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
used as studs, or links, for fastening together clothing.
The fact, indeed, that some have the
central hole worn by the friction of a
thong or string of some kind, coupled
with the worn state of some of their
surfaces, renders this guess very likely
to be true. In <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>, <i>a</i>, the ornament
in right lines, which once covered the
surface as in <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>, <i>b</i>, is very nearly
obliterated by friction against some
soft body such as clothing. A reference
to the figures will give a better
idea of their shape and ornamentation
than a mere description. Two perforated
discs may have been used as
studs. There are also many nondescript
articles, consisting of sockets
made of antler of stag, and bone rods
carefully rounded, together with cut
bones of uncertain use. For the identification
of the ivory boss of a sword-hilt
I am indebted to the kindness of
Mr. Franks.</p>

<p>Besides the ornaments in bone and
antler, there were seven glass beads,
five transparent and two of a bluish
tint, and one of jet turned in a lathe;
as well as a fragment of a jet bracelet.
Among the articles of daily use were
many rounded pebbles, with marks of
fire upon them, which had probably
been heated for the purpose of boiling
water. Pot-boilers, as they are called,
of this kind are used by many savage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
peoples at the present day, and if we wished to heat
water in a vessel that would not stand the fire, we
should be obliged to employ a similar method. Other
stones formed parts of ancient hearths, and two or three
grooved slabs of sandstone had evidently been used
for rounding and sharpening bone pins. The fragments
of pottery were very abundant, and were all of the type
usually found round Roman villas. One fragment of

date of the occupation of the cave. The Samian ware,

it was either Roman or post-Roman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_42"><i>The Coins.</i></h3>

<p>If we turn now to the coins, we shall find the date to
lie within narrower limits than those fixed by the
animals. They consist <span class="locked">of:&mdash;</span></p>

<p id="list_93" class="in0 in2">
Two silver of Trajan, d. 117.<br />
Four bronze of Tetricus I., 267&ndash;274.<br />
One bronze of Tetricus II., 267&ndash;274.<br />
One bronze of Gallienus, d. 268.<br />
One bronze of Constantine II., d. 343.<br />
One bronze of Constans, d. 353.<br />
Three barbarous imitations in bronze of coins of Tetricus, circa 400&ndash;500 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>
</p>

<p>In a group of coins such as this the latest only give a
clue to the date, since the earlier may have remained in
circulation long after they were struck. In India, for
example, those of Alexander the Great have not yet
disappeared from the country, and in Spain, in the shops
of Malaga, Moorish, Roman, and even Phœnician coins
were current in 1863, as well as all those which have been
struck since.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> We may therefore disregard the earliest
coins, and fix our attention more particularly on those of
the Constantine family, and the bronze minimi mentioned
last in the list. The presence of the coin of
Constans implies that the cave was occupied either
during or after 337 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, when he ascended the throne;
while the date of the minimi has not been ascertained
with accuracy. “They abound upon all Roman sites,
such as Verulam and Richborough. In size they come
nearest to those struck under Arcadius and his successors,
and I think that you will not be far wrong in
assigning them to the first half of the fifth century.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
The latest of the genuine Roman coins found in this
country are those of Arcadius and Honorius; at least,
the finding of any of later date is quite exceptional.
What the currency was between that time and the commencement
of the Saxon coinage it is hard to say. It
seems probable, however, that gold and silver had nearly
disappeared, and that the needs of a small local commerce
were supplied by the Roman copper coins of which
abundance remained in the country, and by small pieces
struck after their model, not improbably by private
speculators.” This opinion, which Mr. John Evans, F.R.S.,
has been kind enough to write me, coincides with that
of Mr. Newton, as well as that of Mr. Roach Smith;
and we may therefore assume, with tolerable certainty,
that the cave was inhabited during the first half of the
fifth century or afterwards, at a time when the withdrawal
of the Roman Legions had left the colony of
Britain, whose youth and vigour had been consumed in
the fierce struggle of the rivals for the throne of the
West, a prey to the barbarian invaders.</p>

<p>It is of course conceivable that some of these coins
may have been dropped at one time, and some at another,
but nevertheless it seems very probable that the whole
accumulation belongs to the same relative age. But
whether this be accepted or not, it is certain the cave
was inhabited during the time that the minimi were in
circulation,&mdash;that is to say, during the first half of the
fifth century, or from that time forwards.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_43"><i>The Jewellery, and its Relation to Irish Art.</i></h3>

<p>This conclusion as to the date, derived from the coins,
is confirmed in a remarkable degree by the examination
of the articles of luxury. Besides two bronze brooches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
of the Roman pattern, known by archæologists as harp-shaped
(<a href="#i_frontis">Coloured Plate</a>, fig. 5), was one of the split-ring
type, with a moveable pin, which is generally assigned to
the later period of the Roman occupation of this country.
One type of brooch was composed of two circular plates
of bronze, soldered together, the front being very thin
and bearing flamboyant and spiral patterns in relief (<a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>), of admirable design and execution. The original
of the figure was discovered by Mr. Jackson, and is
more perfect than any of those which we obtained in
our excavations. It is altogether
unlike any Roman brooch properly
so called, both in its composite
make and style of ornament. A
similar brooch has been discovered
at Brough Castle, in Westmoreland,
and was figured in the
Proceedings of the Antiquarian
Society (vol. iv. 129), by Sir
James Musgrave, and a second is
preserved in the Museum of the
Royal Irish Academy (492). The style corresponds
with that of a medallion on a Runic casket of silver-bronze,
figured by Prof. Stevens, and stated to have
been obtained from Northumbrian Britain, as well
as that of a brooch in the Museum at Mainz, assigned
by the same authority to the third or fourth century.
It is also to be met with in the illuminations of one
of the Anglo-Saxon Gospels at Stockholm, as well as
in those of the Gospels of S. Columban, preserved
in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, and in the
“Book of Kells” (8&ndash;900).<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> In all these cases it cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
affirmed to be Roman, and it is not presented by ornaments
of either purely English or Teutonic origin. It
is most closely allied to that work which is termed
by Mr. Franks “late Celtic.” From its localization in
Britain and Ireland, it seems to be probable that it is of
Celtic derivation; and if this view be accepted, there is
nothing at all extraordinary in its being recognized in
the illuminated Irish Gospels. Ireland, in the sixth and
seventh centuries, was the great centre of art, civilization,
and literature; and it is only reasonable to suppose
that there would be intercourse between the Irish Christians
and those of the west of Britain during the time
that the Romano-Celts, or Brit-Welsh, were being slowly
pushed to the westward by the heathen English invader.
Proof of such an intercourse we find in the brief notice
in the “Annales Cambriæ,” in which Gildas, the Brit-Welsh
historian, is stated to have sailed over to Ireland
in the year <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 565. It is by no means improbable
that about this time there was a Brit-Welsh migration
into Ireland, as well as into Brittany.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>&mdash;Bronze Brooch (natural size).</div></div>

<p>Nor is it at all strange that the same style of ornament
should occur in some few cases in North Germany.</p>

<p>“The conquest of Britain,” writes the Rev. J.&nbsp;R.
Green (“History of the English People,” p. 16<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>), “had
thrust a wedge of heathendom into the heart of the
Western Church. On the one side lay Italy and Gaul,
whose Churches owned obedience to the see of Rome, on
the other the free Celtic Church of Ireland. But the
condition of the two portions of Western Christendom
was very different. While the vigour of Latin Christianity
was exhausted in a bare struggle for life, Ireland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
as yet unscourged by invaders had drawn from its
conversion an energy such as it has never known since.
Christianity had been received there with a burst of
popular enthusiasm. Letters and arts sprang up rapidly
in its train; the science and Biblical knowledge which
had fled from the continent took refuge in famous
schools which made Durrow and Armagh the universities
of the West. The new life soon beat too strongly
to brook confinement within insular bounds. Patrick,
the first missionary of Ireland, had not been half a
century dead, when Celtic Christianity flung itself with
a fiery zeal into battle with the mass of heathenism
which had rolled in upon the Christian world. Irish
missionaries laboured among the Picts of the Highlands,
among the Frisians of the northern seas; Columban
founded monasteries in Burgundy and the Apennines;
the canton of St. Gall still commemorates in its name
the missionary before whom the spirits of flood and fell
fled wailing over the waters of the Lake of Constance.
For a time it seemed as if the course of the world’s history
was to be changed, as if the older race that Roman
and Teuton had swept before them had turned to the
moral conquest of its conquerors, as if Celtic and not
Latin Christianity was to mould the destinies of the
Churches of the West.”</p>

<p>It is impossible that Irish-Celtic art should not
have made itself felt wherever the Irish missionaries
penetrated, and especially in the gorgeous illuminated
Gospels, which it was the pride of S. Columban and
his school to have made, and which now excite our
wonder and admiration. The early Christian art in
Ireland grew out of the late Celtic, and was, to a
great extent, free from the influence of Rome, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
is stamped on the Brit-Welsh art of the same age
in this country. The style, therefore, of these circular
brooches, from its correspondence with that of the Irish
illuminated gospels, affords reasonable grounds for the
belief that the Victoria Cave was inhabited in the sixth
century, or possibly later, but before the English invaders
had swept the Brit-Welsh away from the district.</p>

<p>Two other brooches were also discovered in the
black layer, which are even of greater interest than those
which have just been described. The one represents a
dragon (<a href="#i_frontis">colored Plate</a>, fig. 3), with its eye made of red
enamel; the other (<a href="#i_frontis">colored Plate</a>, fig. 7) shaped, like the
letter S, has its front composed of an elaborate cloissonnée
pattern in red, blue, and yellow enamels, and
is of the same design as two brooches in the British
Museum, discovered, one near Whittington Hill, in Gloucestershire,
and the other near Malton, in Yorkshire.
All three were, undoubtedly, turned out of the same
artistic school, and they may have been made by one
workman. The enamel, in all these examples, seems
to have been inserted into hollows in the bronze, and
then to have been heated so as to form a close union
with them, and in some cases where it has been broken,
as in <a href="#i_frontis">colored Plate</a>, fig. 7, small fragments still remain
to attest the completeness of the fusion with the bronze.
The style of workmanship is neither Roman nor Teutonic.
An enamelled fibula with spirals in relief, found
at Reichenbach<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> (Soleure) in a post-Roman sepulchre,
and figured by Bonstettin, is of a similar design, and
it may be traced also in two brooches obtained by
the Abbé Cochet, from the Merovingian Cemetery of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
Envermeu,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> although they are of more massive and
square construction than those of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>One harp-shaped brooch (<a href="#i_frontis">colored Plate</a>, fig. 1) is
ornamented with diamonds of blue enamel, separated
by small triangles of red, and shows in its Roman design
and Celtic ornamentation the union between Celtic and
Roman art. A similar specimen from Brough Castle,
Westmoreland, is preserved in the British Museum, and
may have been turned out of the same workshop. We
also met with an enamelled disk (<a href="#i_frontis">colored Plate</a>, fig. 6),
and a finger-ring (<a href="#i_frontis">fig. 4</a>) of bronze-gilt, ornamented with
blue enamel.</p>

<p>Several enamelled fibulæ in the British Museum, obtained
by Sir James Musgrave, at Kirby Thore, Westmoreland,
belong to the same style of art as those of the
Victoria cave, and were associated with the same class of
remains. Shields,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> scabbards, horse trappings, and other
articles have also been discovered in this county, decorated
in the same fashion with coloured enamels, and especially
a bronze vase from the late Roman tumuli, called the
Bartlow Hills. They all belong to the class termed “late
Celtic” by Mr. Franks, and are considered by him to be
of British manufacture.</p>

<p>This view is supported by the only reference to the
art of enamelling which is furnished by the classical
writers. Philostratus, a Greek sophist, who left Athens
in the beginning of the third century to join the Court
of Julia Domna, the wife of the Emperor Severus,
writes:&mdash;“It is said that the barbarians living in or by
the ocean, pour these colors (those of the horse trappings)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
on heated bronze, that these adhere, grow as hard
as stone, and preserve the designs that are made in
them.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Mr. Franks’ opinion that this passage relates
to Britain, seems to be more probable than that of the
eminent French archæologist, M. de Laborde, who holds
that it relates to Gaul and especially to “Belgica.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>When we consider the variety of enamelled objects
which have been discovered in the north of England, it
seems to be by no means improbable that the principal
centre of the art enamelling was here rather than in the
south; and this conclusion is considerably strengthened
by the fact that under the Romans political power
centered in the district between the Humber and the
Tyne, and that York, and not London, was the capital of
Britain and the seat of the Roman Prefect. It is worthy
of remark, that since the Emperor Severus built the wall
which bears his name, marched in person against the
Caledonians, and died at York, the account of the
enamels may have been brought to the court of the
Empress Julia from this very region, and thus come to
be recorded by Philostratus.</p>

<p>Two harp-shaped fibulæ, obtained by Mr. Jackson
from the Victoria cave, and ornamented with enamel,
are coated with silver, and in one of them two small
blocks of that metal still remain firmly imbedded in the
bronze. It is very probable that most of the ornaments
were plated either with silver or gold, traces of which,
in some cases, still remain.</p>

<p>Among the miscellaneous objects in metal are a bronze<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
wire brooch (<a href="#i_frontis">colored Plate</a>, fig. 8), two bracelets, composed
of twisted bronze-gilt wire; and one fragment in solid
bronze, ornamented with right lines; one plain bronze
finger-ring; two small buckles, respectively of bronze
and of iron, and a small bronze flattened pin (<a href="#i_frontis">colored
Plate</a>, fig. 2), ending in two points to which, at first, we
were unable to assign a use. When, however, the two
points were compared with the circles on the ornaments
of bone (<a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>), there was but little doubt that this
curious object was employed as a pair of fixed compasses.
There were also iron articles which were too
much corroded to admit of a guess at their probable use,
besides a Roman key, knife-blades, and a spear-head
discovered by Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>The number of ornaments found in the Victoria Cave
from time to time by various explorers is very considerable.
They are scattered in the private collections
of Messrs. Jackson and Eckroyd Smith, and in the
Museums of Giggleswick Grammar-school, and of Leeds,
and the British Museum.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_44"><i>Similar remains in other Caves in Yorkshire.</i></h3>

<p>The Victoria cave is by no means the only one in the
district that has furnished works of art and the remains
of animals. The Albert cave (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>, <i>c</i>.) close by is, as
yet, only explored sufficiently to prove that it contains
the same kind of objects; and from that of Kelko, overlooking
Giggleswick, they have been obtained by Mr.
Jackson;<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> as well as from that of Dowker-bottom between
Arncliffe and Kilnsay, by Mr. James Farrer and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Denny.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> From the last, seven spoon-shaped brooches
of bone, and two spindle-whorls of Samian ware of
the bottom of a vase, are preserved in the British
Museum, as well as a bronze needle, and brooches
both harp-shaped and discoid, and fragments of pottery.
Three coins in bronze, according to Mr. Farrer,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
prove that the date of the accumulation is late or post-Roman,
one being of Claudius Gothicus, whose reign
ended <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 270, and two belonging to the Tetrici, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>
267&ndash;273, since they would remain in circulation for
some time after they were struck. A bronze pin, in
the possession of Mr. Jackson, from Dowker-bottom, is
remarkable for the head being plated with silver.</p>

<p>The fragment of flattened antler from this cave, referred
by Mr. Denny to the elk, most probably belongs to the
crown of an old antler of the stag, and the remains of
the “Canis primævus” of that author cannot be distinguished
from those of a large dog. The bones of the
wolf, and an enormous stag in the Museum of the
Philosophical Society at Leeds, are probably much older
than the Brit-Welsh stratum.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_45"><i>These Caves used as Places of Refuge.</i></h3>

<p>The presence of these works of art, in association with
the remains of the domestic animals used for food, is
only to be satisfactorily accounted for in the way proposed
by Mr. Dixon. Men accustomed to luxury and
refinement were compelled, by the pressure of some great
calamity, to flee for refuge, and to lead a half-savage life
in these inclement caves, with whatever they could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
transport thither of their property. They were also
accompanied by their families, for the number of personal
ornaments and the spindle-whorls imply the
presence of the female sex. We may also infer that
they were cut off from the civilization to which they
had been accustomed, since they were compelled to
extemporize spindle-whorls out of the pieces of the
vessels that they brought with them, instead of using
those which had been manufactured for the purpose.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_46"><i>The evidence of History as to the Date.</i></h3>

<p>We have already seen from the examination of the
coins, that the Victoria cave was occupied during or after
the first half of the fifth century, and from the works of
art that it may have been, and probably was, occupied at
a later time. To fix the latest possible limit to the occupation
of the group of caves to which it belongs, we
must appeal to contemporary history.</p>

<p id="hdr_47">During the first four centuries of Roman dominion in
Britain, the spread of the manners and arts of the great
mistress of the world followed close upon her success in
arms; and the policy of one of the greatest of her generals,
Agricola, bore fruit in the adoption of her civilization by
the British provincials. The population clustered round
the Roman stations, and cities sprang up, such as Chester,
Bath, York, and Lincoln, between which a ready communication
was maintained by the roads that still remain
as monuments of engineering skill, and which, in many
cases, have been used uninterruptedly from that time to
the present day. Agriculture was carried on to such an
extent, that Britain became one of the principal corn-producing
regions of the Roman Empire; and a commerce
with foreign countries was carried on from the ports on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
banks of the Thames and the Severn (Gildas, i.). The
mineral sources were also fully explored; tin was sought
in the mines of Cornwall, lead in those of Derbyshire
and Somersetshire, and iron in the forest of Dean, Sussex,
and Northumberland. Nor was this material prosperity
unaccompanied by the signs of luxury and culture.
Numerous villas were dotted throughout the province,
resembling in size and plan the quadrangle of a mediæval
college at Oxford or Cambridge, and even in ruins
astonishing us by their magnitude and the beauty of
their tessellated pavements. York was the capital of
the province and the centre of government, and consequently
Yorkshire must have been, if anything, more
completely penetrated with the Roman arts and civilization
than any other part of Britain. The relation of the
Roman conquerors to the conquered Celtic inhabitants was
somewhat analogous to that which now exists between
the English and the subject nations in India. Latin was
the language spoken by the higher classes in the cities, of
the army, and probably of the courts of law; while in
the country the Celtic tongue held its ground, and still
survives in the language of Wales. Christianity was
probably professed in this country about the time of
Constantine, and became the dominant religion by the
middle of the fifth century, if not before.</p>

<p>Underneath all the outward signs of prosperity during
the Roman rule in Britain, there were causes at work
which ensured the ruin of the province. The policy of
centralization, and the very perfection of the machinery
for government on autocratic principles, which brought
about the destruction of the Roman Empire, as in our
own days they have nearly ruined France, bore fruit in
Britain in the helpless apathy of the provincials when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the machinery was broken up. It is therefore no wonder
that when the Roman garrison was finally withdrawn
from this country, in the year 409, the provincials
were left an easy prey to their enemies. Nor need we
wonder that they set up isolated centres of government,
which we may term communes, in the year 410, in
which each city stood out for itself, instead of combining
together for the common weal. From this time forward
the inhabitants of the Roman province of Britain, severed
from the Roman Empire, became a prey to the many
tyrants who sprang up, and the anarchy followed so
pathetically described by Gildas. It was at this time
that the coinage became debased, and Roman coins
afforded the patterns for the small bronze minimi of the
Settle cave,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> which are so abundant among the ruins
of Roman cities in this country, such as St. Alban’s.</p>

<p id="hdr_48">The invaders of Britain must now be considered. The
Picts and Scots had secured a rude liberty under the
protection of their mountains and morasses, rather than
by their success in arms against the Roman legions, and
their raids into the Roman province had been curbed by
the walls and lines of forts, extending, the one from the
Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde, the other from the
Solway Firth to the Tyne. In spite of these, however,
from time to time, in the fourth century, they carried
desolation into Northumberland and Yorkshire, even if
they did not penetrate farther into the south. And on
the withdrawal of the Roman legions, at the beginning of
the fifth century, their raids were organized on a much
larger scale. In the pages of Gildas we have a melancholy
picture of their results. In the letter written to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Ætius, the Roman commander in Gaul, in 446, the
Britains are described as sheep, and the Picts and Scots
as wolves. “The barbarians drive us back to the sea;
the sea drives us back again to perish at the hands of
the barbarians,” are the words put into the mouth of the
embassy.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> One plea for aid, which they advanced, is
especially interesting, because it shows incidentally that
the Roman civilization did not disappear with the withdrawal
of the legions&mdash;the plea that unless they were
succoured the name of Rome would be dishonoured.
Nerved by despair, the British in the following year take
up arms, and, according to Gildas, leave their houses and
lands, and taking shelter in mountains and forests, and
in caves,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> succeed in driving back their Pictish and
Scottish enemies.</p>

<p>It is very significant that <em>caves</em> should be mentioned
in this account; for the region of Craven is one of the
very few in the country in which they are sufficiently
abundant to allow of their being used as places of
shelter on a scale sufficiently large to be recorded in
history; and when we consider that one of the natural
highways from Scotland into central England lies
through that district, it seems to me extremely probable
that the group of caves of which Victoria is one
is that referred to. On this point it is worthy of record,
that in the year 1745, when the younger Pretender was
at Shap, and it was doubtful whether he would take the
route through Ribblesdale or by way of Preston, the eldest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
son of one of the landowners near Settle, was hidden,
along with the family plate, in a Cave close to the
Victoria, in the belief that the Highlanders were in the
habit of eating children as well as of laying hands on
the precious metals. The historical notice tallies exactly
with the geographical position, and is not inconsistent
with the evidence offered by the coins and other remains.
The date, therefore, of the occupation may probably be
assigned as about the middle of the fifth century.</p>

<p id="hdr_49">This, however, is not the latest date that can be
assigned. In the year 449, the three ships which
contained Hengist and his warriors, landed at Ebbsfleet,
in Thanet, and the first English colony was founded
among a people who were known to the strangers as
“Brit-Welsh.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> From that time a steady immigration
of Angle, Jute, Saxon, and Frisian set in towards the
eastern coast of Britain, as far north as the Firth of
Forth, until, in the first half of the sixth century, the
whole of the eastern part of our island was taken possession
of by various tribes,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> whose names, for the most
part, still survive in the names of our counties. The
principal rivers also afforded them a free passage into
the heart of the country, and the kingdom of Mercia gradually
expanded until it embraced, not only the basin
of the Trent, but reached as far as the line of the Severn.
The river Humber afforded a base of operations for the
Anglian freebooters, who founded the kingdom of Deira
or modern Yorkshire; while the camp of Bamborough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
was the centre from which Ida, who landed with fifty
ships in the year 547, conquered Bernicia, or the region
extending from the river Tees to Edinburgh. The tide
of English colonization rolled steadily westward, until, at
the close of the sixth century, the hilly and impassable
districts culminating in the Pennine Chain, and extending
southwards from Cumberland and Westmoreland,
through Yorkshire and Derbyshire, formed the barrier
between the Brit-Welsh kingdoms of Elmet and Strathclyde
on the east, and the English on the west. To the
south of this the Brit-Welsh dominion was bounded by
the river Severn, and included Chester and the whole of
the basin of the Dee; while Somerset, Devon, and
Cornwall, and the district round Bradford and Malmesbury
formed the kingdom of West Wales.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>The long war by which the borders of England were
gradually pushed to the west, at the expense of the
Brit-Welsh, was one of the most fearful of which we
have any record. The English invaders came over, with
their wives and children and household stuff, in such
force that the country which they left behind was left
desolate for several centuries. Worshippers of Thor and
Odin, and living a free life, equally divided between
farming, hunting, and war, they were mortal foes to
Christianity and to Roman civilization. They destroyed
the Brit-Welsh cities with fire and sword; and the ashes
of the Roman villas, which are to be found in nearly
every part of the Roman province of Britain, testify to
the keenness of their hate to everything which was at
once Christian, Roman, and Celtic. Gildas forcibly describes
the destruction which they wrought among his
countrymen, by the metaphor that “the flame kindled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
in the east, raged over nearly all the land, until it flared
red over the western ocean.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> In the conquered districts
the Brit-Welsh were either exterminated or enslaved,
and their civilization was wholly replaced by the rude
culture of the English.</p>

<p>It follows, from the nature of this conquest, that any
group of remains, such as those in the caves under consideration,
must be assigned to the time before the
English had possession of the district, and we must therefore
see what historical proof is to be found on the point.</p>

<p>At the close of the sixth century the Brit-Welsh
kingdom of Elmet (in the basin of the river Aire)&mdash;a
name which still survives in Barwick-in-Elmet, a little
village about seven miles to the north-east of Leeds&mdash;extended
over the country round Leeds and Bradford,
passing westwards towards, if not into, Lancashire, and
northwards probably so as to embrace Ribblesdale, and
forming a barrier to the westward advance of the English
possessors of eastern Yorkshire. Its downfall will
give us the latest possible limit which we are seeking for
the Brit-Welsh occupation of the Victoria Cave. The
two kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia had united to form
the powerful state of Northumbria, at the beginning of
the seventh century, under Æthelfrith, who carried on the
war against the Brit-Welsh with greater vigour than his
predecessors. In 607<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> he marched along the line of the
Trent, through Staffordshire, avoiding thereby the difficult
and easily-defended hilly country of Derbyshire and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
East Lancashire, to the battle near Chester, famous for
the destruction of the power of Strathclyde, and the
death of the monks of Bangor, who fought against him
with their prayers. By this decisive blow, the English
first set foot on the coast of the Irish Channel, and
Strathclyde and Elmet, on the one hand, were cut
asunder from Wales. On the other Chester was so
thoroughly destroyed that it remained in ruins for
nearly three centuries, to be rebuilt by Æthelflæd, “the
Lady of the Mercians,” in 907, and the plains of Lancashire
lay open to the invader.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> This western advance
of the Northumbrians was completed by the conquest of
Elmet, in 616, by Eadwine, and the whole district from
Edinburgh, as far south as the Humber, and as far west
as Chester, became subject to his rule.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> The latest possible
date, therefore, that can be assigned for the occupation
of these caves by the Brit-Welsh is determined by
that event. It cannot be later than the first quarter of
the seventh century, or the time when what remained of
Roman art and civilization in that district was swept
away by the ancestors of the present dalesmen. The
relics in the caves must have been accumulated in the
two centuries which elapsed between the recall of the
legions in the days of Honorius and the English conquest.
They are traces of the anarchy which existed in those
times, and they tell a tale of woe, wrought on the Brit-Welsh,
by Pict, Scot, or Englishman, as eloquently as
the lament of Gildas, or the mournful verses of Talliesin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
They complete the picture of the desolation of those
times revealed by the ashes of the villas and cities
which were burned by the invaders.</p>

<p>We have now examined the evidence as to date offered
by the contents of these caves, and we have seen that it
agrees with the contemporary history. It may therefore
be concluded that it lies in the fifth and sixth
centuries, possibly the first quarter of the seventh.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Bone Harpoon (natural size).</div></div>

<p>This occupation of the Victoria Cave by the Brit-Welsh
is a mere episode in its history. It was inhabited
by man in the neolithic age, at a time so remote that
the interval between it and the historical period can
only be measured by the rude method by which geologists
estimate the relative age of the rocks. At the
entrance the dark Romano-Celtic or Brit-Welsh stratum
(<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>, No. 4; <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>, No. 4) lay buried, as we have
seen, under an accumulation of angular fragments of stone
which had fallen from the cliff. It rested on a similar accumulation
(<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>, No. 3; <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>, No. 3) which was no
less than six feet thick, and at the bottom of this, at the
point where it was based on a stiff grey clay, a bone harpoon
(<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>) was discovered, as well as charcoal; a bone
bead (<a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>), three rude flint flakes, and the broken
bones of the brown bear, stag, horse, and Celtic shorthorn
(<i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>). The harpoon is a little more
than three inches long, with the head armed with two
barbs on each side, and the base presenting a mode of
securing attachment to the handle which has not before
been discovered in Britain. Instead of a mere projection
to catch the ligatures by which it was bound to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
shaft, there is a well-cut barb on either side, pointing in
a contrary direction to those which form the head.
Ample use for such an instrument would be found in
Malham tarn, some three miles off, and
very probably also in that which formerly
existed close by at Attermire, but which
has been choked up by peat, and is now
turned into grass-land by drainage. The
remains of the brown bear consist of
numerous hollow bones and teeth, and
the shaft of a femur with its articular
ends broken off, has been polished by
friction against some soft substance, so
that its surface has a lustre like that of
glass.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span> Bone-bead (natural size.)</div></div>

<p>The question naturally arises, who were
the ancient inhabitants of the cave whose
rude implements occur in this lower stratum?
From the few remains which we
discovered, they were hunters and fishermen,
and the possessors of domestic oxen,
and possibly horses, and in a much lower
state of civilization than the Brit-Welsh
inhabitants who succeeded them in the
cave after a long interval. There is no
proof that they used a coinage, or that
they were acquainted with metal. The
conclusion that they were neolithic is
based on the following evidence:&mdash;In
1871 the Exploration Committee examined
a small cave about 200 yards off, in King’s
Scar, and obtained the broken bones of the stag, Celtic
short-horn (<i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>), goat, and horse, a whetstone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
and a rudely chipped scraper, to which, subsequently,
Mr. John Birkbeck, jun., made the important
addition of part of a human thigh-bone. This set of
remains, the human thigh-bone excepted, agrees with
those in the lower stratum in the Victoria Cave, not
merely in the absence of metal, but also in affording
signs of a comparatively rude civilization; and we might
reasonably expect that the two caves so close to each
other, would have been occupied by the same people at
approximately the same time. If this be allowed, the
thigh-bone may be assigned to one of these earlier inhabitants,
the place of habitation being, as is frequently
the case, subsequently used for purposes
of burial. The thigh-bone itself is characterized
by the great development of
the muscular ridge known to anatomists
as the <i class="taxonomy">linea aspera</i>, implying the peculiar
flatness of shin which is termed
by Professor Busk platycnemism. This
peculiar form has been met with in the neolithic tumuli
of Yorkshire, explored by the Rev. Canon Greenwell, as
well as in the human remains which I have discovered
in the neolithic caves and chambered tombs of Denbighshire;
and since it has not been observed in any human
skeletons in this country which are not of that age, it
may be fairly taken to prove that a neolithic people
formerly lived in Ribblesdale. And further, since the
traces of rude culture met with in these two caves are
the same as those which characterize neolithic burial and
dwelling places throughout Europe, they may be assigned
to that remote age. Similar human remains were obtained
by Mr. Farrer from the Dowker-bottom Cave, and imply
that that cave also was used as a neolithic burial-place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
The identification of this race with the Basque
or Iberian stock, from which are descended the small,
dark peoples of Derbyshire, Wales, and certain parts of
Ireland, must be referred to the chapters on the Neolithic
Caves.</p>

<div id="Fig_28" class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>&mdash;Stone Adze: <i>a</i>, side view; <i>b</i>, edge (natural size).</div></div>

<p>The reputed discovery of an adze (<a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>), of a
variety of greenstone which Mr. Wyndham identifies
with melaphyr, many years ago in the Victoria Cave,
may offer additional evidence as to its having been
occupied by a neolithic tribe. It was presented to the
Museum of the Philosophical Society at Leeds by Mr.
Jackson, and figured by Mr. Denny among the remains
from the Caves of Craven, and presents characters
that have not, to my knowledge, been met with in
any other neolithic implement found in Great Britain:
one end being roughly chipped for insertion into a
socket, while the other is carefully ground into a
chisel edge. In these respects, as Mr. O’Callaghan and
Mr. Denny have observed, it bears a striking resemblance
to the stone adzes used by the South Sea Islanders,
and especially in Tahiti;&mdash;a resemblance so strong that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
unless it had been traced from the hands of the discoverer
into the Museum at Leeds, it would be considered
by many archæologists as an implement actually
obtained from the South Seas. It may have been derived
from the lower stratum, which furnished the equally
peculiar harpoon, <a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_51"><i>The Approximate Date of the Neolithic Occupation.</i></h3>

<p>From the position in which these remains occurred,
it is obvious that a neolithic tribe occupied the cave
before the accumulation of the angular fragments, six
feet in thickness (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>, No. 3; <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>, No. 3), just
as the date of the Brit-Welsh occupation is fixed as
being after this, and before the accumulation of the
two feet of débris above (No. 5). And in this we have a
means of roughly estimating the interval of time between
them. It is clear that the accumulation of two feet of
angular fragments, torn away by the action of the
weather from the cliff, has been formed in about 1,200
years, <i>i.e.</i> between the Brit-Welsh occupation and the
present time. If it be admitted that equal quantities
of the cliff have been weathered away in equal times, it
will follow that the thickness of six feet between the
Brit-Welsh stratum and that under examination was
formed during a time thrice as long, or 3,600 years; and
that consequently the date of the earlier occupation of
the cave by man is fixed as being about 4,800, or 5,000
years ago. It is perfectly true, that in ancient times
the frosts may have been more intense than they are
now, and therefore that the rate of weathering may have
been faster. To the objection that possibly a large mass
of cliff may have tumbled down at one time, and subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
been disintegrated, it may be answered, that at the
point at the entrance where the section was taken there
was no evidence of any such fall; the angular blocks,
both above and below the Brit-Welsh stratum, being as
nearly as possible of the same size, and not lying with
their faces parallel to each other, as would have been the
case had they been disintegrated fallen blocks. Nevertheless
this attempt to fix a date cannot lay claim to
scientific precision, and in that respect is neither better,
nor worse, than any other similar attempt founded on
the rate at which a valley is being excavated, or alluvium
being deposited, or on the retrocession of a waterfall,
such, for example, as Niagara. It is merely valuable as
enabling us to form some sort of idea of the high
antiquity of the neolithic men who left these remains
behind in the cave.</p>

<p>As the trench (see <a href="#Fig_20">Figs. 20</a>, <a href="#Fig_21">21</a>) begun on the outside
passed into the entrance of the cave, the accumulation
of stones above the neolithic stratum disappeared, and
the latter became intermingled with the Brit-Welsh layer
above, so that it would have been impossible to distinguish
the one from the other had not the talus marked
the interval in the plateau outside. The talus also
above the Brit-Welsh stratum ceased at the entrance,
although here and there large blocks of stone, fallen
from time to time from the roof, rested on its upper
surface.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_52"><i>The Grey Clays.</i></h3>

<p>Immediately below the neolithic stratum, a deposit of
stiff grey clay of unknown depth occupies both the
entrance and the inside of the cave (<a href="#Fig_20">Figs. 20</a>, <a href="#Fig_21">21</a>), containing
fragments of limestone and large angular blocks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
which had fallen from the roof. A shaft sunk to a depth
of twenty-five feet near the entrance failed to arrive at
the bottom, but presented the following section in
descending order: stiff grey clay with layer of stalagmite
six feet thick; a finely laminated calcareous clay twelve
feet thick; and below, a similar bed of clay to that on the
surface. In a second shaft sunk to the depth of twelve
feet farther within the cave, the base of the grey clay
was not reached.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<div id="Fig_29" class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="400" height="360" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;Section below Grey Clay at entrance.</div></div>

<p>A third shaft, at the entrance, however, penetrated the
clay, No. 1 of <a href="#Fig_20">Figs. 20</a>, <a href="#Fig_21">21</a>, <a href="#Fig_29">29</a>, at a depth of about five
feet, and revealed the existence below of a reddish-grey
loamy cave-earth (<a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>), containing bones and
teeth of the same animals as those from the caverns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
of Kent’s Hole, Wookey Hole, and others, which belonged
to a group that invaded Europe before the glacial period,
and that inhabited the region north of the Alps and the
Pyrenees in pre- and post-glacial times.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>We subsequently discovered the cave-earth to be from
three to four feet thick, and that it rested on an accumulation
(<a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>) of large blocks of limestone, the interstices
between which were filled with clay, sometimes laminated
and at others homogeneous, as well as with coarse sand.
Below this we broke into an empty passage, one side
of which was formed by the solid rock, and the other of
blocks of stone imbedded in the clay.</p>

<p>As we opened out a horizontal passage towards the
cave-earth, <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>, from the outside, the talus (<a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>) of
angular débris was cut through first, which gradually
became more and more clayey in its lower portions: at
one point, <span class="smcap smaller">D</span>, there were several glaciated blocks, some
imbedded in clay and others perfectly free. It rested
obliquely on the edges of the cave-earth, and passed
gradually at the entrance into the clay occupying the
interior of the cave.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_53"><i>The Pleistocene Occupation by Hyænas.</i></h3>

<p>The remains of the spelæan variety of the spotted
hyæna were very abundant in the cave-earth, consisting
of fragments of skulls, jaws, and bones, and especially
of coprolites, which formed irregular floors, accumulated
during successive occupations of the cave by
that animal. All the bones were gnawed and scored by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
teeth, the lower jaws were without the angle and coronoid
process (see <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>), and the hollow bones which contain
marrow were broken, while those which were solid and
marrowless were for the most part perfect: and this held
good, not merely of the remains of the hyæna, but of those
of all the animals which constituted their prey. The bones,
for example, of the woolly rhinoceros are represented
merely by the hard distal portion of the shaft of the
humerus, and of the solid bones of the ulna and radius,
while the only portions of skull are the solid pedestal
offered by the nasal bones on which the front horn was
supported, and a few smaller fragments. The pedestal
in question is depicted by the dark shaded portion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
<a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>, the outline of the skull and lower jaw being
taken from one of Professor Brandt’s plates of the
Woolly Rhinoceros found in Siberia.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> The teeth which
imply the presence of the mammoth (milk molars 3 and
4) were those of a young individual, as is very generally
the case in caves which have been occupied by hyænas.
The young would naturally be more exposed to the attack
of those cowardly beasts of prey than the adult, armed
with its long curved tusks, and defended, not merely by its
thick skin, but also by the covering of wool and long hair
which is peculiar to the species. Besides these animals,
the reindeer, red-deer, bison, horse, the brown, grizzly, and
great cave bears, were preyed upon by the hyænas and
dragged into the cave. All these species were discovered
within an area of a few square yards of cave-earth,
which passes into the interior of the cave under
the grey clay. They belong to that well-defined group
known as pleistocene, quaternary, or post-pleiocene, which
was proved to have inhabited Yorkshire<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> in ancient times
from Dr. Buckland’s discoveries in Kirkdale, and Mr.
Denny’s examination of the river-deposit at Leeds, in
which the remains of the hippopotamus were obtained.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>&mdash;Skull of Woolly Rhinoceros, showing the part which is not eaten by the hyænas.</div></div>

<p>The last and most important addition to this fauna
is that of man, a fragment of fibula in the same
mineral condition as the rest of the pleistocene bones,
having been identified by Professor Busk with an
unusually massive recent human fibula. Although the
fragment is very small, its comparison with the abnormal
specimen in Professor Busk’s possession removes all doubt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
from my mind, as to its having belonged to a man, who
was contemporary with the cave-hyæna and the other
pleistocene animals found in the cave.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_54"><i>The probable Pre-glacial Age of the Pleistocene Stratum.</i></h3>

<p>Is this occupation of the Victoria Cave by the pleistocene
mammalia pre-glacial or post-glacial?&mdash;before, or
after, the great lowering of the temperature in northern
Europe? This difficult question can only be answered
by an appeal to the physical history of the clay and
cave-loam, and to the evidence as to glacial action in
the district, and to the distribution of the mammalia
in Great Britain during the pleistocene period. Glaciers
have left their marks in nearly every part of Lancashire
and Yorkshire, and especially in the neighbourhood of
the Victoria Cave. The hill-sides around are studded
with large ice-borne Silurian rocks; boulder-clay occupies
nearly every hollow on the elevated plateaux; and
moraines are to be observed in nearly every valley.
At the entrance of the cave itself, ice-scratched Silurian
grit-stones are imbedded in the clay, which abuts directly
on the cave-loam, and passes insensibly into the clay,
with angular blocks of limestone within the cave. They
may possibly be the constituents of a lateral moraine <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in
situ</i>, as Mr. Tiddeman suggests, or they may merely
be derived from the waste of boulder-clay which has
dropped from a higher level.</p>

<p>The latter view seems to me to be most likely to be
true, because some of the boulders have been deprived
of the clay in which they were imbedded, and are piled
on each other with empty space between them, the clay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
being carried down to a lower level and re-deposited.
Their position, however, on the edges of the cave-earth
implies, in any case, that they had been dropped after
its accumulation.</p>

<p>There is another point to be considered in the physical
evidence. The deposits above the cave-earth,
occupying the interior and entrance of the cave, have
been introduced by the rains, either through the
entrance, or through the crevices which penetrate the
roof, and consist of a finer detritus washed out of the
boulder-clay on the surface at a higher level. The cave-earth,
however, although it has been introduced in the
same way, cannot be accounted for on the supposition
that it was derived from the boulder-clay, with which
it contrasts in the fact that it is a loam, of a reddish
grey colour, containing a large percentage of carbonate
and phosphate of lime.</p>

<p>Similar deposits, characterized by their red colour, are
to be found in nearly all the caves of the south of England,
in France, and southern Europe, not complicated,
as here, by the glacial phenomena of the district. Had
the layer been formed in the Victoria Cave, from the
destruction of the boulder-clay, it would have been
identical in composition with the deposits above.</p>

<p>The laminated portions of the grey clay are considered
by Mr. Tiddeman to have been formed by the flow of
water through the entrance, derived from the daily
melting of the glacier which occupied the valley in
ancient times, and he compares it with a similar lamination
in the boulder-clay at Ingleton, which has
been described by Mr. Binney in the neighbourhood of
Clifton, near Manchester, under the expressive name of
“book-leaves.” Since, however, similar accumulations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
are being formed at the present time at the bottom of
pools in many caves, as, for example, in that of Ingleborough,
they cannot be taken to imply a glacial origin.
They are not found merely in one spot in the Victoria
Cave, but are scattered, more or less, through the general
mass of the clay, and occur abundantly even below the
cave-earth, having been deposited in the interstices
between the large blocks of limestone. In these positions
they are of uncertain age, and there is no reason why
some of the hollows which we discovered below the
cave-earth (<a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>) should not be filled with them at
the present time by the heavy rains. They dip at all
angles, and are conformable to the surfaces on which
they have been dropped.</p>

<p>The most important argument in favour of the
pre-glacial age of the mammaliferous cave-earth is
afforded by the range of the animals in Great Britain
during the time that certain areas were occupied by
glaciers. In a paper read before the Geological Society
in 1869, I showed that those areas in Great Britain in
which the marks of glaciers were the freshest and most
abundant coincided with those which were barren of
the remains of the pleistocene mammalia, and I therefore
inferred that this was due to the fact, that the
areas in question were covered by ice at the time that
pleistocene animals were so numerous in the caves, and
river-deposits of southern and eastern England, and on
the continent. In a map published in 1871, Cumberland,
Westmoreland, Lancashire, and the greater portion
of Yorkshire are represented as being one of these
barren areas, in which no pleistocene mammalia have
been observed. It is obvious that the hyænas, bears,
mammoths, and other creatures found in the pleistocene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
stratum, could not have occupied the district when it
was covered by ice; and had they lived soon after the
retreat of the ice-sheet, their remains would occur in the
river-gravels, from which they are absent throughout a
large area to the north of a line drawn between Chester
and York, whilst they occur abundantly in the glacial
river deposits south of that line. On the other hand,
they belong to a fauna, that overran Europe, and must
have occupied this very region before the glacial period,
since their remains have been found in pre-glacial strata
to the north in Scotland, to the south at Selsea, and
to the east in Norfolk and Suffolk. It may, therefore,
reasonably be concluded that they occupied the cave in
pre-glacial times, and that the stratum in which their
remains lie buried, was protected from the grinding of
the ice-sheet, which destroyed nearly all the surface
accumulations in the river-valleys, by the walls and
roof of rock, which has since, to a great extent, been
weathered away.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> This view is also held by Mr.
Tiddeman.</p>

<p>The exploration of the Victoria Cave, which has
hitherto yielded such interesting evidence of three distinct
occupations&mdash;first by hyænas, then by neolithic
men, and lastly by the Brit-Welsh, is by no means
complete. The cave itself is of unknown depth and
extent, and the mere removal of so much earth and
clay as it is at present known to contain will be a
labour of years. The results of the exploration, up
to the present time, are of almost equal value to the
archæologist, to the historian, and the geologist, and
prove how close is the bond of union between three
branches of human thought which at first sight appear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
remote from each other. The discussion of the problems
connected with the neolithic and pleistocene
strata must be referred to the <a href="#CHAPTER_V">fifth</a> and following
chapters.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_55"><i>The Kirkhead Cave.</i></h3>

<p>Other caves in this country, besides the group under
consideration in Yorkshire, have been occupied by the
Brit-Welsh. That known as the Kirkhead Cave, on
the eastern shore of the Promontory of Cartmell, on the
northern shore of Morecambe Bay, explored by Mr.
J.&nbsp;P. Morris,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> and a Committee of the Anthropological
Society in 1864&ndash;5, contained remains of the same type
as those of the Brit-Welsh stratum in the Victoria Cave.
In the débris which formed the floor and extended to an
unknown depth below, a coin of Domitian, “a trefoil-shaped
Roman fibula,” a pin, ornamented with green
enamel, and a bronze ring were discovered in association
with broken remains of domestic animals&mdash;<i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>,
pig and goat, dog and horse, as well as stag,
roe, wild goose, and many human bones. A bronze celt
and a spear-head were also found, at a depth respectively
of five and six feet, and a flint flake at a
depth of seven feet; and fragments of pottery, a bead
of amber, cut bones, the perforated head of the femur,
and other articles. From this group of remains it may
be inferred that the cave was occupied by the Brit-Welsh,
and before them by the users of bronze, and
possibly by a neolithic people, and that it had at some
time or another been used as a place of burial. Just
inside the entrance, which overlooked the sea at a
height of 45 feet, a semi-circular breastwork of large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
stones rendered the cave habitable, and capable of easy
defence.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris’s view that the discovery of a bronze celt,
flint flakes, and coins in this cave proves that all three
were in use at the same time, and by the same people, is
not borne out by the published account of the excavation.
There is no proof that the deposit had not been disturbed,
or that the articles were not dropped at different
times. And in support of this conclusion, it may be
advanced, that there is no case on record of the discovery
of bronze celts or swords along with any Roman coins
under conditions which would prove that they were in
use at the same time. Had such been the case the
ruins of the many Roman villas and cities, destroyed by
the English, would have furnished some examples. At
Silchester, even such a rare article as a Roman eagle has
been met with. There is every reason to believe with
Sir John Lubbock, Mr. Evans, and other eminent
archæologists, that the use of bronze for weapons had
been superseded by that of iron before the dawn of
history in this country. It is otherwise with the flint
flakes; since my discovery of several inside a Roman
coffin at Hardham, near Pulborough, in Sussex, in a
cemetery that belongs to the later portion of the Roman
dominion in Britain, proves that they were used for
some purpose at that time.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_56"><i>Poole’s Cave, near Buxton.</i></h3>

<p>In the collection of articles obtained from Poole’s Cave,
in Buxton, in Derbyshire, I identified, in 1871, in
company with Mr. Pennington, bronze Roman coins,
minimi, Samian and other ware, and large quantities of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
broken bones of the same animals as those from the
Victoria Cave. A bronze harp-shaped fibula of the type
of <a href="#i_frontis">Fig. 5</a> of the coloured Plate is inlaid with silver, and
is so perfect that it might still be used.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_57"><i>Thor’s Cave, near Ashbourne.</i></h3>

<p>A cave also, in Staffordshire, four miles from Ilam,
explored by the Midland Scientific Association in 1864,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
under the supervision of Mr. Carrington, has furnished
articles of the same kind as those of Yorkshire. It is
known as Thor’s cave, and penetrates the lofty cliff of
limestone, on the south side of the river Manifold, at a
height of about 254 feet from the bottom of the valley,
and about 900 feet above the sea, running horizontally
inwards, and being divided inside by a row of buttressed
columns into two noble gothic aisles. Its bottom was
occupied by clay, in which, near the entrance, there were
thick layers of charcoal at depths of two, three, and
four feet below the surface, mingled with broken bones
and pottery, that indicated the spots where fires had
been kindled. The articles discovered were as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;Armlet, two fibulæ of harp pattern (see
<a href="#i_frontis">coloured Plate</a>, Fig. 5), two plain breast-pins and rings,
a curious wheel-shaped instrument.</p>

<p>“<i>Iron.</i>&mdash;Large triangular fork, arrow-heads, lance-heads,
several knives and a chopper, of singular shapes,
reaping hook (?), adze, pins, two girdle hooks (?), &amp;c.</p>

<p>“<i>Bone.</i>&mdash;Seven snags of deer’s horns, variously cut and
perforated, several others not perforated, curious bone
comb ornamented with circles, flat bone perforated with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
four holes, two leg-bones carved at the ends, pin, a large
quantity of bones of animals that had been consumed for
food.</p>

<p>“<i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Greenstone pounder, fragments of querns,
perforated disk, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“<i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;A large collection of fragments of various
periods, among the rest several pieces of true Samian
ware.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin Brown, from whose report this list is taken,
concludes that Thor’s cave was occupied during “the
late Celtic and Romano-Celtic periods.” The harp-fibulæ
are of a pattern identical with several of those discovered
in the Victoria Cave, and the holes at their upper ends
were probably intended for the reception of enamel.
The bronze instrument, consisting of a disk cut out into
a flamboyant pattern like that of the round brooch from
the Victoria Cave (<a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>), and joined to a central stem
ornamented with waved lines, was intended for suspension;
possibly, as Mr. Carrington suggests, it may have
been used for spinning. It is a remarkably fine example
of Brit-Welsh or late Celtic art. The bone comb is of the
same type as those from the Brit-Welsh caves of Yorkshire.
It is evident, from Mr. Brown’s account, that there
were distinct layers of occupation; but, unfortunately,
the articles found in each were not separated from the
rest. One armlet (<a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>), composed of a thin plate
of bronze, and ornamented with a dotted-line pattern,
is of the peculiar type which is characteristic of the
bronze age.</p>

<p>The cave had also been used as a place of sepulture,
for near “the pulpit rock,” and at a depth of five feet
from the surface, a skeleton rested in the sitting posture
which is so characteristic of neolithic interments in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Europe. It had also been entered by man even before
any of these accumulations. “In the south recess,
behind and below any traces of man’s occupation, the
diggers came upon a kind of flooring of tabular masses
of breccia stretching almost across the cave, and on one
side attached firmly to the wall,” beneath which rested,
in the undisturbed clay, a deer’s horn, rudely sawn across
and perforated by two holes.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Bronze Bracelet from Thor’s Cave.</div></div>

<p>Thor’s Cave, therefore, like the Victoria, has been
occupied by man in the Brit-Welsh stage of the historic
period, as well as in the bronze, and possibly in the
neolithic ages.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_58"><i>Historic Value of Brit-Welsh Group of Caves.</i></h3>

<p>The discovery that caves were used as habitations by
men accustomed to the elegance of civilized life, not
merely in Yorkshire, but in districts so far removed from
each other as Staffordshire and the extreme north of
Lancashire, during the fifth and sixth centuries, implies
the pressure of a far-reaching calamity by which they
were driven from their homes. It completes and rounds
off the story of the social condition of the country during
these troubled times, which is revealed in the sacked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
and burned Brit-Welsh cities and villas, as well as in the
scanty records of the English invasion.</p>

<p>Subsequent investigation will probably show that
caves were occupied at this time in every part of the
country which was conquered by the English. In the
upper stratum of Kent’s Hole, for example, near Torquay,
similar articles, with the exception of the enamels,
have been discovered. There, however, the occupation
may have been considerably later than in the caves of
Yorkshire, because the Roman civilization was not supplanted
in Devonshire by the English until the beginning
of the ninth century. The river Tamar then marked the
frontier between the English, and the Brit-Welsh of the
promontory of Cornwall, which represented the dominion
of West Wales in the days of Ecgberht.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>In the numerous caves of Wales, on the other hand,
which I have explored, there is no trace of inhabitants
of the fifth and sixth centuries, a circumstance that is
easily accounted for by the fact that Wales was not
invaded at that time by the English. There would
therefore be no reason for the civilized Brit-Welsh to
fly to caves for refuge.</p>

<p>All the less important animals and articles are omitted
from this list. It will be observed that the brown bear,
the wolf, and the fallow-deer are absent. The brown
bear was probably at this time very rare in Britain,
since its remains have been met with in but two out of
the many Roman refuse-heaps in the country, at London
and Colchester. The well-known lines of Martial, however,
imply that it was imported from Britain to Rome at
this <span class="locked">time&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>

<p>It probably became extinct about the ninth or tenth
century. The wolf obviously would not be likely to be
used for food, although it probably was abundant in the
district. The fallow-deer also had not penetrated into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the hilly districts, although it had become naturalized in
this country by the Romans, so as to have been frequently
used as an article of food before the English invasion.
I have seen its characteristic antlers in refuse-heaps,
both in London and Colchester, which have furnished
Roman coins and pottery.</p>

<p>The beaver was probably very rare in the fifth and
sixth centuries, and has been met with in no cave-deposit,
either historic or prehistoric, in this country.
It was, however, known to the Anglian conquerors
of Yorkshire (Northumbria), who called Beverley (lea,
leag-) after its name.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_60"><i>The Use of Horseflesh.</i></h3>

<p>The broken bones of the horse, in all the caves above
mentioned, leave no room to doubt that horseflesh was a
common article of food at that time. It was so, indeed,
throughout Roman Britain, and after the English invasion
was used as late as the Council of Celchyth,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> in the
year 787. It was forbidden by the Church because it was
eaten by the Scandinavian peoples in honour of Odin.
In Norway,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> Hacon, the foster-son of Æthelstan, was compelled
to eat it by the bonders, in 956, and the revolt of
the bonders which ended in the bloody battle of Stikklestadt,
in which Olaf met his death, in 1030, was caused
by his cruelties to the eaters of horseflesh. As Christianity
prevailed over the worship of Thor and Odin, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
was banished from the table. The present prejudice
against its use is a remarkable instance of the change in
taste, which has been brought about by an ecclesiastical
rule aimed against a long-forgotten faith. The rule was
not, however, always obeyed, for the Monks of St. Gall,
in the eleventh century, not only ate horseflesh, but
returned thanks for it, in a metrical grace, written by
Ekkehard the Younger (died 1036):&mdash;</p>

</div>

<h3 id="hdr_61"><i>The Cave of Longberry Bank.</i></h3>

<p>The cave of Longberry Bank, near Penally, in Pembrokeshire,
may also be classed with those which were
inhabited in historic times, since it contained red fine-grained
pottery of a kind commonly found in the ruins
of Roman villas. It was explored by the Rev. H.&nbsp;H.
Winwood, in 1866, in whose collection are the remains of
the <i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>, goat, badger, dog, as well as shells of
oyster, large limpets and mussel from the neighbouring
shore. Some of the bones are burned. Several human
vertebræ and a metacarpal were probably the traces of an
interment of unknown date; and the two flint flakes are
of uncertain age.</p>

<p>The results obtained by the exploration of the
caves described in this chapter are to be taken merely
as the first-fruits of a new line of inquiry, which is
likely to throw light on many points relating to art,
history, and the range of the animals, and not as being
perfect or final. On the continent, no historic caves of
importance have as yet been explored.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_62"><i>The Difference between Historic and Prehistoric Time.</i></h3>

<p class="in0">It will be necessary before we examine the group of
caves used by man in prehistoric times, to point out the
important difference in the measurement of time within
and beyond the borders of history. When we speak,
for example, of the date of the Norman Conquest, we
imply that we can ascertain by historical records, not
merely that it succeeded the invasion of Britain by the
English or Danes, and happened before our own time,
but that the interval which separates it from those events
can be accurately measured by the unit of years. If, however,
we attempt to ascertain the date of any event which
happened outside the historical limit, we shall find that
it is a question solely of relation. When we speak, for
example, of the neolithic age, we merely mean a certain
stage of human progress which succeeded the palæolithic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
and preceded the bronze age, but we have no
proof of the length of the interval dividing it from the
one or the other. The historic “when?” implies “how
long ago?” the prehistoric “when?” merely implies a
definition before and after certain events, without any
idea of the measurement of the intervals.</p>

<p>An attempt to ascertain the absolute date of prehistoric
events must of necessity fail, since it is based
on the improbable assumption that the physical agents
have acted uniformly, and that therefore the results may
be used as a natural chronometer. The present rate of
the accumulation of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i>, as at the Victoria Cave of
the preceding chapter, or of that of silt in the deltas
of rivers, such as the Nile, or the Tinière, may convey
a rough idea of the high antiquity of prehistoric deposits;
but a slight change either of the climate, or of the
rainfall, would invalidate the conclusion. When the
greater part of Europe lay buried under forest, when
Palestine supported a large population, and when glaciers
crowned some of the higher mountains of Africa, such
as the Atlas, the European and Egyptian climates
were probably moister than at the present time, and
the rainfall and the floods greater, and consequently the
accumulation of sediment quicker than the observed rate
under the present conditions. And in the same way all
estimates of the lapse of past time, based upon the
excavation of a river valley, or the retrocession of a
waterfall, such as Niagara, lie open to the same kind of
objection. It is not at all reasonable to suppose that
the complex conditions which regulate the present rate
of erosion, have been the same during the time the work
has been done, and it therefore follows that the work
done is a measure of the power employed, and not of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
the length of time during which it has been in operation.
We must, therefore, give up the idea of measuring the
past beyond the memory of man, as represented in
historical documents, by the historic unit of years. We
can merely trace a definite sequence of events, separated
one from another by uncertain intervals. And for that
series of events which extends from the borders of
history back to the remote age where the geologist,
descending the stream of time, meets the archæologist,
I have adopted the term prehistoric.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_63"><i>The Prehistoric Fauna.</i></h3>

<p>The prehistoric period is characterized by the arrival
of the domestic animals in Europe, under the care of
man. The dog, swine, horse, horned-sheep, goat, <i class="taxonomy">Bos
longifrons</i>, and the larger ox descended from an ancestor,
according to Professor Rütimeyer, of the type of the
great Urus, make their appearance together, in association
with the remains of man, in the neolithic stage of
civilization.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> Subsequently they spread over the whole
of our continent, for the most part under the care of
man. The <i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>, however, and possibly also
the Urus, reverted to feral conditions, just as the horses
and oxen, in the Americas and Australia, have done at
the present time, and their remains are therefore frequently
found in association with animals undoubtedly
wild. The domestic horse, the variety of hog descended
from the wild boar, and the domestic cattle derived from
the Urus, may possibly have passed under the yoke of man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
in Europe, since their wild stocks were to be found in
that area, both in the prehistoric and pleistocene times.
This, however, cannot be affirmed of the swine descended
from the southern variety of <i class="taxonomy">Sus Indica</i>, or of the Celtic
shorthorn, of the sheep, or goat, since their wild ancestors
were not indigenous in Europe. These animals must
have been domesticated in some area outside Europe;
and since central Asia is the region where the wild stocks
still exist, from which all the domestic animals are
descended, it is reasonable to suppose that they were
domesticated in that region, and thence introduced, by a
race of shepherds and herdsmen, into our quarter of
the world.</p>

<p>This conclusion is considerably strengthened by the
evidence which Professor Heer has advanced, as to the
vegetables used by the dwellers on piles in the Swiss
lakes, among which some, such as the two kinds of
millet, the six-rowed barley (hordeum hexastichon), the
Egyptian wheat (triticum turgidum), and a weed (Silene
cretica), accidentally brought along with them, are
distinctively of southern derivation.</p>

<p>The most important wild animals living in this
country during the prehistoric period are the urus, the
gigantic skulls of which occur in the peat bogs of
England and Scotland, the Irish elk, the moose (<i class="taxonomy">Cervus
alces</i>), and the reindeer. The two last are far more
abundant in the north than in the south of Britain; their
remains have been discovered in the neighbourhood of
London, those of both animals at Walthamstow, and
those of the latter at Crossness in Kent, on the banks
of the Thames. The remains of the bison have not been
recorded from any prehistoric deposit in this country.</p>

<p>The Irish elk is the only animal which has become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
extinct; while the moose, or true elk, is the only wild
species which has not been proved to have been living
in the preceding age. The stag was very abundant.</p>

<p>The prehistoric fauna is distinguished from that of the
pleistocene not merely by the appearance of the animals
above mentioned, which were hitherto unknown, but by
the absence of many species which were living during
the latter period. The cave bear, woolly rhinoceros, and
mammoth, for example, became extinct, the musk-sheep
and lemming were banished from a temperate latitude to
take refuge in the regions of the north, while the spotted
hyæna, the hippopotamus, and Felis caffer, retired to the
warm regions of Africa, where they are still living.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_64"><i>The Archæological Classification.</i></h3>

<p>The prehistoric period has been classified by the
archæologists according to the stages of human progress
which it presents. At the frontier of history, in each
country, we find that the dwellers were acquainted with
the use of iron, and had found it to be the most convenient
material for the manufacture of cutting weapons
and implements. Before this the voice of tradition
points out that bronze was the only material used for
these purposes, and stone before bronze. These three
stages of human culture, or the ages of iron, bronze, and
stone, have been fully verified by investigations which
have been made in various parts of Europe, into the
prehistoric habitations and burial-places of man.</p>

<p>This classification by no means implies an exact
chronology, or that any one of these ages, with the
exception perhaps of the first, covered the whole of
Europe at the same point of time, but that the order in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
which they followed each other is the same in each
country which has been explored. There is good reason
for the belief, that at the time the Egyptian and Assyrian
empires were in the height of their glory, Northern
Europe was inhabited by rude polished-stone-using races.
And it is a well-ascertained fact, that while the inhabitants
of Britain and Scandinavia were in their bronze age, the
Etruscans and Phœnicians were in their full power in
the south. It is obvious again, that, even in the same
country, the poorer classes must have been long content
to use the ruder and more common materials for their
daily needs, while the richer and more powerful used the
rarer and more costly. These three ages must therefore
necessarily overlap. “Like the three principal colours
of the rainbow,” writes Mr. Evans,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> “these three stages
of civilization overlap, intermingle, and shade off the one
into the other; and yet their succession, as far as Western
Europe is concerned, appears to be equally well defined
with that of the prismatic colours, though the proportions
of the spectrum may vary in different countries.” They
cannot reasonably be viewed as hard and fast lines of
division, mapping off successive quantities of time.</p>

<p>The age of stone is subdivided by Sir John Lubbock
into the neolithic periods, or that in which polished stone
was the only material used for cutting, and the palæolithic,
in which mankind had not learnt to grind and
polish his implements. The latter belongs to the pleistocene,
or quaternary period, since the palæolithic implements
are found in association with the remains of the
animals characteristic of that age.</p>

<p>The prehistoric caves, therefore, may be divided into
three classes if the archæological method of analysis be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
employed: 1, into those containing evidence of the use
of iron; 2, those containing proof of the knowledge of
bronze; 3, and lastly, those in which traces of polished
stone weapons have been discovered unassociated with
metals. By the animal remains which they contain
they may be distinguished from those of the pleistocene
age, both by the absence, as well as the presence of
certain species which have been enumerated.</p>

<p>From the archæological point of view, two out of the
four ages are still represented. Stone is, at the present
time, the only material used in the more remote regions
of Australia, although it is fast being replaced by iron,
which has superseded bronze, and is spreading rapidly
over the whole earth. The group of historic caves
described in the preceding chapter may be said to belong
to the iron age, that is to say, to that later portion of it
in which the events are recorded in history.</p>

<p>The traces of the occupation of caves by man in the
iron and bronze ages are so extremely scarce, that it is
certain that they were but rarely used as habitations.
Man had sufficiently advanced in civilization in those
times to construct artificial dwellings and tombs for
himself, instead of using the natural shelters which
were so very generally occupied in Europe by his
ruder neolithic predecessors.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_65"><i>Cave of the Iron Age.</i></h3>

<p>In the course of the systematic exploration of caves
in the Mendip Hills, carried on by Messrs. Ayshford
Sanford, Parker, and myself, a cave was examined in
Burrington Combe, near Wrington, in Somerset, which
may be referred to the iron age, and which we named
Whitcombe’s Hole. It opened upon the side of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
magnificent combe, at a height of about 135 feet from
the bottom and fifteen from the top, and ran horizontally
inwards, the floor being formed of an accumulation of
earth mingled with charcoal, and containing numerous
broken bones and teeth. The latter belonged to the wolf,
fox, badger, rabbit, hare, stag, goat, and Celtic shorthorn.
In the lower portion were the fragments of a rude, unornamented
urn of a coarse black ware, with the rim
turned at right angles, along with a bent piece of
iron, which bears a strong resemblance to those found
strengthening the corners of wooden coffins in the Gallo-Roman
graves on the banks of the Somme. The
fractures of the bones, with one exception, were caused
by the hand of man, and not by the teeth of the carnivora.
The position renders the cave eminently fitted for
concealment, for while commanding an extensive view
down the Combe, it is invisible both from above and
below, and opening on the face of an almost vertical
cliff, it is easily defended. If the urn be sepulchral, the
interment must be of a later date than the occupation,
because it is made in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i> which resulted from the
latter.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_66"><i>Caves of the Bronze Age in Britain.</i></h3>

<p>The cave of Heathery Burn,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> near Stanhope, in Weardale,
co. Durham, is the only one in this country that
has furnished a large series of articles of the bronze
age. It is described by Mr. Elliott as running into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
precipitous side of a ravine, at a height of about 10 to
12 feet above the level of the Stanhope Burn, and as
being partially traversed by water. Since its discovery in
1861, it has been altogether destroyed by the removal
of the stone to be used as a flux in smelting the ore of
the Weardale Iron Company, and an admirable section
of its contents was therefore visible from time to time.
A stratum of sand at the bottom, two feet nine inches
thick, deposited by the stream, and containing angular
masses of limestone that had dropped from the roof, was
covered by a sheet of stalagmite three inches in thickness.
On this rested a mass of bones and implements imbedded
in silt or sand, and sealed over by a thickness of stalagmite
of from two to eight inches.</p>

<p>On removing the upper of these two stalagmitic floors
a perfect human skull was discovered, along with broken
bones of animals, charcoal, limpet shells, bone pins, an
instrument of bone like a paper-knife, coarse pottery
with fragments of chert imbedded in its mass, a portion
of a jet armlet, as well as several boars’ tusks. The same
stratum at another place furnished a singular bronze
knife with a socket for the handle (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>),<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> bronze pins,
celts, an armlet of twisted wire (<a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>), along with
shells of limpet, mussel, and oyster, and charcoal, and at
a third, on the other side of the watercourse, a bronze<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
spear-head. Subsequently, many articles were added to
the above list, seven pins, three rings, two split-rings,
a “razor,” disk, three socketed celts, one chisel, two
gouges, and four spear-heads of bronze, and a fine
bracelet, and two ornaments of the horse-shoe, or split-ring
type, made of thin plates of gold. One of the
spear-heads, in the collection of the Rev. Canon Greenwell,
is represented in <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>. There were also waste
pieces of bronze, and the half of a bronze mould for
casting celts, <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>, in which one of the associated
celts had actually been cast, since it is of the same pattern.
These articles were probably concealed in the cavern by
workers in bronze, who were prevented, by some unforeseen
accident, from obtaining them again. The charcoal
and the broken bones of the <i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>, badger, and
dog, imply that the cave had been used as a habitation;
and possibly the two human skulls, which have been
described by Professor Huxley and Mr. Carter Blake, may
have belonged to the possessors of the hoard of bronze
and gold. Both were discovered in the same stratum
and below the floor of stalagmite.</p>

<p>The more perfect of the two skulls is considered by
Professor Huxley to belong to the same long-headed
race of men as that found at Muskham, in the valley of
the Trent,&mdash;to a form which he terms the River-bed type,
and that cannot be separated from those obtained from
the long tumuli of the South of England, and considered
by Dr. Thurnam to belong to a Neolithic Basque,
or Iberian population.</p>

<p>Articles distinctly of the bronze age have been already
noticed as having been met with in the caves of Kirkhead,
in Cartmell, and in Thor’s Cave, in Staffordshire.
From the latter the bracelet of thin bronze, <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
obtained by Mr. Carrington, of Wetton. The rarity of
bronze implements in caves in Britain and the Continent
is probably, to a large extent, due to the value of the
material, and to the fact that it could be re-melted. If
a bronze article happened to be broken, the pieces
would naturally be kept for future use, and not thrown
away, as in the case of a fractured stone implement.
The former, therefore, are rare, the latter comparatively
abundant.</p>

<p>The cave called the Cat-Hole, in Gower (Glamorgan),
explored by Colonel Wood in 1864, contained several
human skeletons, flint flakes, fragments of red pottery
marked with a string, cut bones, a stone muller, and
a bronze socketed celt. The last is of the same pattern
as some of those in the collection of the Rev. Canon
Greenwell, from Heathery Burn, and has been cast in
a mould similar in size and ornamentation to that
figured in <a href="#Fig_35">woodcut 35</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_67"><i>The Caves of Césareda probably occupied by Cannibals.</i></h3>

<p>The contents of three caves<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> in the Iberian peninsula,
referable to the dawn of the bronze age, render it very
probable that the use of human flesh was not unknown
in those times.</p>

<p>In 1867 Senhor J.&nbsp;L. Delgado described his researches
in the caverns of Césareda, in the valley of the Tagus,
in the Casa da Maura, Lapa Furada, and Cova da Maura.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
The first of these contained two distinct strata. The
lower, consisting of sand mixed with fragments of rock,
rested on the stalagmite, and contained fragments of
charcoal, one implement of bone, and many of flint, a
scraper, a flake, and an arrow-head. The broken bones
and teeth belonged to the following animals:&mdash;The lynx,
fox, brown-bear, dog and wolf, a species of deer, the
water-vole, and the rabbit. None of the remains of the
carnivora had been subjected to the action of fire, or
had been used for food. A human skull with lower jaw
was dug out of the deepest part, but, since the matrix
had been disturbed, it had probably been interred after
the accumulation of the deposit.</p>

<p>It is recognized by Professor Busk<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> as belonging to
the same long type as the skulls of the caves of Gibraltar
and the Basque graveyard, measuring in length
6·7 inches, in breadth 5·3, in height 5·5, and therefore
possessing cephalic and latitudinal indices of ·785 and
·820.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>The upper stratum, a sandy loam, contained a large
quantity of stones, and numerous articles fabricated by
man: polished-stone axes, flakes, and other instruments
of flint, bone, and antler, fragments of coarse black
pottery, with bits of calcareous spar imbedded in its
substance, and two plates of schist ornamented with a
rude design, which may have been used as amulets.
Fragments of charcoal were scattered throughout the
matrix, and adhered to some of the pottery and to the
burnt pebbles. The most abundant remains were those
of man. They were to be counted by thousands, and
were so fragmentary and scattered that it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
to put together one perfect skeleton. The teeth, belonging
for the most part to children or fully-grown adults,
were particularly abundant. The long bones had lost,
very generally, their articular ends, had been fractured
longitudinally, and some of them had been cut and
scraped. It is therefore probable that this accumulation
was formed by a tribe of cannibals: the evidence that
human flesh formed their principal food being precisely
of the same nature as that by which the flint-folk of the
Périgord are proved to have subsisted on the flesh of
the reindeer. Professor Busk,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> however, is inclined to
believe the facts in support of cannibalism insufficient.
The associated animals consisted of the bat, dormouse,
rabbit, horse, a small ox, allied to <i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>, sheep
or goat, wild cat, wolf, fox, and dog. The contents
of the other two caves were precisely of the same
nature, and had been accumulated under the same
conditions.</p>

<p>A bronze arrow-head, discovered in the upper stratum,
and the ornamentation of the stone amulet, consisting of
alternate triangles and zigzag ladders, as remarked by
Mr. John Evans, indicate that the upper deposit belongs
to the age of bronze, and probably to an early stage,
when stone was being superseded by bronze, since many
stone celts were found in the same spot.</p>

<p>The ancient burial-places of Ultz, in Westphalia,
furnish a second case of the practice of cannibalism,
according to M. Schaaffhausen of Bonn<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>. They are
probably of the age of bronze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_68"><i>The Cave of Reggio, in Modena.</i></h3>

<p>The human remains in a cave in the province of
Reggio,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> on the northern flank of the Apennines, brought
before the Prehistoric Congress at Bologna by M. l’Abbé
Chierici, and considered by him to be proofs of cannibalism,
are probably merely the result of interment in a
refuse-heap that had previously been accumulated. They
were associated with bronze pins, rivets, polished-stone
axes, and various implements of bone, fragments of
pottery and of charcoal, bones of pig, sheep, and dog,
and belong therefore to the period of transition from the
neolithic to the bronze age.</p>

<p>The caves have contributed but very little to our
knowledge of the bronze-folk in any part of Europe.
Examples, such as those given above, are scattered through
France and Spain, but they are not sufficiently important
to require notice. We could not expect that men, in
the high state of civilization implied by the beautiful
jewellery and ornaments which are distinctive of the
bronze-folk, would have chosen the wild, half-savage life
which is involved in cave-habitation.</p>

<p class="in0">It is evident, from the scanty remains found in caves,
that they were not the normal habitations of men in the
Bronze or Iron stages of culture. We shall, however,
find that they were used by the neolithic peoples, both
for shelter and for burial, in nearly every portion of
Europe which has been explored.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_69"><i>Neolithic Caves in Great Britain.&mdash;Perthi-Chwareu.</i></h3>

<p>The most remarkable examples of caves, turned to
both these uses, in Britain, are offered by the group
clustering round a refuse-heap at Perthi-Chwareu, a
farm high up in the Welsh hills, about ten miles to the
east of Corwen, and a mile to the west of the little
village of Llandegla, in Denbighshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Refuse-heap.</i></h3>

<p>The first intimation of any prehistoric remains in that
locality was afforded by a small box of bones forwarded
to me by Mr. Darwin, in 1869; and this I was able to
follow up, through the kind assistance of Mrs. Lloyd,
the owner of the property on which they were found,
from time to time, during 1869&ndash;70&ndash;71&ndash;2. The mountain
limestone, which there forms hill and valley, consists
of thick masses of hard rock, separated by soft beds of
shale, and contains large quantities of <em>producti</em>, crinoids
and corals. The strata dip to the south, at an angle
of about 1 in 25, and form two parallel ridges, with
abrupt faces to the north, and separated from each
other by a narrow valley, passing east and west along
the strike. The remains sent by Mr. Darwin were
obtained from a space between two strata near the top
of the northern ridge, whence the intervening softer
material had been carried away by water. Its maximum
height was 6 inches, and its width 20 feet or more;
and it extended in a direction parallel to the bed of
the rocks. The bones, which had evidently been washed
in by the rain, and not carried in by any carnivora,
belong to the following <span class="locked">species:&mdash;</span></p>

<p id="list_150" class="in0 in4">
<i class="taxonomy">Canis familiaris</i>&mdash;The Dog.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">Canis vulpes</i>&mdash;The Fox.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">Meles taxus</i>&mdash;The Badger.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">Sus scrofa</i>&mdash;The Pig.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">Cervus capreolus</i>&mdash;The Roe-deer.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">Cervus elaphus</i>&mdash;The Red-deer.<br />

<i class="taxonomy">Lepus timidus</i>&mdash;The Hare.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">Lepus cuniculus</i>&mdash;The Rabbit.<br />
The Eagle.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Nearly all the bones were broken, and belonged to
young animals. Those of the Celtic short-horn, of the
sheep or goat, and of the young pig, were very abundant;
while those of the roe and stag, hare and horse, were
comparatively rare. The remains of the domestic dog
were rather abundant, and the percentage of young
puppies implies also that they, like the other animals,
had been used for food. Possibly the hare may also
have been eaten, but its remains were scarce, and belonged
to adults. Some of the bones had been gnawed
by dogs. The only reasonable cause that can be assigned
for the accumulation of the remains of these animals is,
that the locality was inhabited by men of pastoral habits,
but yet to a certain extent dependent on the chase, and
that the relics of their food were thrown out to form a refuse-heap.
The latter had altogether disappeared from
the surface of the ground, from the action of the rain and
other atmospheric causes, while those portions of it which
chanced to be washed into the narrow interspace between
the strata were preserved, to mark the spot which it
once occupied.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the deposit that fixes the date
of its accumulation. It may have been of the stone,
bronze, or iron age; but from the presence of the goat,
short-horned ox, and dog, it certainly does not date so far
back as the epoch of the reindeer, mammoth, rhinoceros,
and cave-hyæna. The presence of the Celtic short-horn
throws no light upon the antiquity, because for centuries
after it had ceased to be the domestic breed in England
it remained in Wales, and still lives in the small black
Welsh cattle, that are lineal descendants of those
which furnished beef to the Roman provincials in
Britain.</p>

<h3><i>The Sepulchral Caves.</i></h3>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>&mdash;Section of Cave at Perthi-Chwareu. Scale 12 feet to 1 inch.</div></div>

<p>While the refuse-heap was being explored, I chose a
small depression (<a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a> <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>) in the precipitous side of the
southern ridge, that formed a kind of rock shelter overlooking
the valley, and that seemed to be a likely place
for the abode of man, or of wild animals. On setting
the men to work, in a few minutes we began to discover
the remains of dog, marten-cat, fox, badger, goat, Celtic
short-horn, roe-deer and stag, horse, and large birds.
Mixed with these, as we proceeded, we began to find
human bones, between and underneath large masses of
rock, that were completely covered up with red silt and
sand. As these were cleared away, we gradually realized
that we were on the threshold of a sepulchral cave. In
the small space then excavated, human remains, belonging
to no fewer than five individuals, were found. Subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
the work was carried on by Mrs. Lloyd, under
the careful supervision of her agent Mr. Reid. The rock-shelter
narrowed into a “tunnel cave,” that penetrated
the rocks in a line parallel to the bedding, and, roughly
speaking, at right angles to the valley, having a width
varying from 3 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 6 inches, and a
height from 3 feet 4 inches to 4 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>The entrance was completely blocked up with red
earth and loose stones, the latter, apparently, having
been placed there by design (<a href="#Fig_36">Figs. 36</a>, <a href="#Fig_37">37</a>). The inside
of the cave was filled with red earth and sand to within
about a foot of the roof. The remains were found, for
the most part, on or near the top; but in some cases
they were deep down. One human skull, for example,
was found six inches only above the rocky floor. The
human bones were associated with those of the animals
of which a list has been given, and occurred in little
confused heaps. One human femur was in a perpendicular
position. The account of the continuation of
the digging is given almost in the words of Mrs. Lloyd.
On the second day, after an hour’s work, a human skull
was found near the roof of the cave, resting on a femur;
then eleven feet explored brought to light a large
quantity of human bones, including nine femurs. The
third and fourth days were devoted to clearing out the
cave (<a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>&ndash;<a href="#Fig_37">7</a> <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>) up to this point, and to excavating
about four feet further in, or fifteen from the entrance.
During the work two teeth of a horse were found, resting
on the floor near the entrance, and nine more about ten
feet within the cave; also a boar’s tusk of remarkable
size, and close by a mussel and cockle-shell, and valve of
<i class="taxonomy">Mya truncata</i>, along with a quantity of human and
other bones; including five skulls, more or less perfect,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
and many fragments. All these skulls were found
between the tenth and fifteenth feet from the entrance.
During the fifth and sixth days, the work was superintended
by Mr. Reid, who entirely cleared the cave for
about thirteen feet further: the first eight feet yielded a
small quantity of human and other bones, including the
perfect skull of a marten-cat and the incisor of a wild
boar. The only implement found in the cave, a broken
flint flake, occurred here, and a nearly perfect human
skull, lying face downwards, with the pelvis adhering to
one side. The last five feet furnished only two bones,
both of the short-horned ox. The end of the cave was
composed of unproductive grey clay. (<a href="#Fig_36">Figs. 36</a>&ndash;<a href="#Fig_37">7</a> <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Small fragments of charcoal occurred throughout the
cave, and a great many rounded pebbles from the boulder
clay of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The human remains belong for the most part to very
young or adolescent individuals, from the small infant
to youths of twenty-one. Some, however, belong to
men in the prime of life. All the teeth that had been
used were ground perfectly flat. The skulls belong to
that type which Professor Huxley terms the “river-bed
skull.” Some of the tibiæ present the peculiar flattening
parallel to the median line, which Professor Busk denotes
by the term platycnemic, and some of the femora were
traversed by a largely developed and prominent <i class="taxonomy">linea
aspera</i>; but these peculiarities were not seen on all the
femora and tibiæ, and cannot therefore be considered
characteristic of race, but most probably of sex. They
were not presented by any of the younger bones.</p>

<p>All the human remains had undoubtedly been buried
in the cave, since the bones were in the main perfect,
or only broken by the large stones which had subsequently
fallen from the roof. From the juxtaposition
of one skull to a pelvis, and the vertical position of one
of the femora, as well as the fact that the bones lay in
confused heaps, it is clear that the corpses had been
buried in the contracted posture, as is usually the case
in neolithic interments. And since the area was insufficient
for the accommodation of so many bodies at one
time, it is certain that the cave had been used as a
cemetery at different times. The stones blocking up the
entrance were probably placed as a barrier against the
inroads of wild beasts.</p>

<p>These remains are the first in this country which
present the peculiar character of platycnemism, noticed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
by Professor Busk and Dr. Falconer in human remains
in the caves of Gibraltar, and by Dr. Broca in some of
those from the dolmens of France, and subsequently in the
celebrated skeletons found in the cave of Cro-magnon. I
have also observed the same peculiar flattening of the
tibia in the only fragment of human bone obtained by
Mr. Foote, in the Lateritic deposits of the eastern coast
of Southern India, along with the stone implements
figured in the Norwich Volume of the International Congress
of Prehistoric Archæology (1868, p. 224).</p>

<p>The remains of the animals associated with the human
bones belong to the same species as those mentioned
above from the débris of a refuse-heap, and are in a
similar broken and split condition. They may have
been deposited at the same time as the human skeletons,
but, from the fact that some of them are gnawed by
dogs, it is most probable that they were accumulated
while the cave was used as a dwelling. If the bodies
were placed on an old floor of occupation, and afterwards
disturbed by rabbits and badgers, the remains
would be mingled together as they were found to be
mingled. The contents had evidently been disturbed by
the burrowing of all these animals.</p>

<p id="hdr_70">Subsequently we discovered and explored no less than
four other sepulchral caves, within a few hundred yards
of the refuse-heap, in which the corpses had been buried
in the same crouching posture. From one on the farm
of Rhosdigre we obtained a perfect celt of polished
greenstone which had never been used (<a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a>),
together with several flint flakes, and numerous fragments
of pottery, rude, black inside, hand-made, and
containing in their substance small fragments of limestone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Similar potsherds are preserved in the Oxford Museum,
from the superficial deposits of the caves of Gailenreuth
and Kuhlock, and I have observed them also among the
remains from Kent’s Hole. The celt was most probably,
from its unworn condition, buried with the dead,
and it stamps the neolithic age of the interments of the
whole group.</p>

<div id="Fig_38" class="figcenter" style="width: 324px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span>&mdash;Greenstone Celt, Rhosdigre Cave. (Nat. size.)</div></div>

<p>Among the broken bones from this cave were the teeth
of the brown bear, and the lower jaw of a wolf; and
the fractured bones of the dog implied that that animal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
ministered to the appetite, as well as obeyed the commands,
of the neolithic inhabitants. I have met with
similar evidence of the use of dog’s flesh for food among
the broken bones which Canon Greenwell obtained from
the neolithic tumuli of the Yorkshire Wolds. On the
other hand, the marks of the teeth of dogs, or wolves,
on some of the human femora, implied that those
animals made their way into this cave and feasted on
the corpses.</p>

<p>The neolithic age of these interments is proved, not
merely by the presence of the stone axe, or of the flint
flakes, but by the burial in a contracted posture,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> and the
fact that the skulls are identical with those obtained
from chambered tombs in the south of England proved
to be neolithic by Dr. Thurnam.</p>

<p>The number of skeletons of all ages, and of both sexes,
buried in these caves was very considerable; and they
had been placed on the old floor of occupation at successive
times. In that of Rhosdigre the accumulation of
charcoal, broken bones, and fragments of pottery below
some of the human skeletons, proved that it had been
used for a habitation before it was used for a burial-place.
It is very probable that originally the head of a
family, or a clan, or a tribe, was buried in his own cave-dwelling,
and that it was afterwards used as a cemetery
for his blood relations and followers.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_71"><i>The Neolithic Caves in the neighbourhood of Cefn, near
St. Asaph.</i></h3>

<p>The same class of remains, referable to the neolithic
age, have been met with in the caves in the limestone
cliffs of the beautiful valleys of the Clwyd and the
Elwy, near St. Asaph. In the collection of fossil bones
in the possession of Mrs. Williams Wynn, discovered in
1833, in a cave at Cefn, by Mr. Edward Lloyd,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> is a
human skull and lower jaw, along with platycnemic
limb-bones. They were found mingled with the bones
of goat, pig, fox, and badger, and cut antlers of the
red-deer, inside the lower entrance of the cave, in which
the extinct pleistocene animals were found in the valley
of the Elwy. Four flint flakes also were discovered
along with them.</p>

<p>The skull in its general features strongly resembles
those found in the group of caves at Perthi-Chwareu,
and presents a cephalic index<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> of ·770, which comes
within the limits of the extreme forms from that locality.
Professor Busk, however, as will be seen in his account
of this skull, because of its low altitudinal index&mdash;·702,
as compared with ·710 of the lowest Perthi-Chwareu
skull&mdash;is inclined to view it as of a different type. The
conditions, on the other hand, under which it was found
appear to me to be circumstantial evidence that the
interment is of the same relative age as that of Perthi-Chwareu.
Both were in caves: in both the remains of
the same domestic and wild animals were found in the
same fragmentary condition. Flint flakes also occurred
in both; and what is more important, the platycnemic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
limb-bones in both imply a somewhat similar mode of
life in the people to whom they belonged. This body of
evidence, in favour of the interments having been made
by the same race of men who lived some time in Denbighshire,
seems to me of greater weight than that to the
contrary afforded by the difference of ·008 in the altitudinal
indices of the skulls. After a comparison of the
carefully prepared measurements of the crania published
in the “Crania Britannica” with those published elsewhere,
I cannot resist the conviction, that if similar
modes of life and of burial in Britain imply an identity
of race, cranial variation within the limits of that race is
by no means very small. Absolute purity of blood in an
island so near the Continent as Britain cannot be looked
for; and unity of type resulting from isolation from other
races, such as that presented by the Australians, is not
likely to be met with. It is therefore very probable that
some of the variations may be accounted for by the blending
of different ethnical elements in one race. I am consequently
inclined to view the interments in these two
caves as having been made by the same people, in spite of
the small cranial difference manifested by the Cefn skull.</p>

<p>The cave in Brysgill, a small ravine leading into the
valley of the Elwy, explored by Mr. Mainwaring and
Mrs. Williams Wynn in 1871, furnished evidence of the
occupation of man, probably of the neolithic age. From
a dark layer composed of loam, black with fragments of
charcoal, a flint arrow-head, a core, a flake, and broken
bones of the horse, <i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>, goat, and dog, were
obtained, as well as a few human bones which had not
been broken by design.</p>

<p>The excavations carried on in the small tunnel-cave
of Plas-Heaton, by Mr. Heaton and Professor Hughes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
have shown that it was inhabited at two different ages.
In the upper or prehistoric stratum were broken bones of
the dog, badger, goat, <i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>, and stag; while
in the lower, or pleistocene, were the remains of the
hyæna, reindeer, cave-bear, and the lower jaw of the
glutton.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_72"><i>The Chambered Tomb near Cefn, St. Asaph.</i></h3>

<p>While the caves at Perthi-Chwareu were being explored,
the accidental discovery of human remains in the
cairn of Tyddyn Bleiddyn, near Cefn, St. Asaph, in 1869,
led to a systematic examination of its contents by Mrs.
Williams Wynn, under the superintendence of the Rev.
D.&nbsp;R. Thomas, myself, and the Rev. H.&nbsp;H. Winwood,
which has resulted in the proof, that the people who
buried their dead in caves used stone-chambered tombs
for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The cairn of loose fragments of limestone had been
removed for road-mending before the cap-stones of the
stone chamber were exposed, and these were broken
before any scientific observation was made. The Rev.
D.&nbsp;R. Thomas, however, rescued many of the human
remains from destruction, and began the exploration
which defined the extent of the chamber <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> (<a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>).</p>

<div id="Fig_39" class="figleft up1" style="width: 194px;">
  <img src="images/i_162.jpg" width="194" height="425" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>&mdash;Plain of Chambered Tomb at Cefn.</div></div>

<p>Subsequently it was resumed in my presence, and the
chamber <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> (<a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>) fully cleared out. At the point <i>c</i>
it was partially shut off from the passage <span class="smcap smaller">B</span> by a slab
of stone 18 inches high. The passage led from the
chamber in a northern direction, and was 6 feet long
by 2 wide. The chamber gradually narrowed towards
the passage, being 5 feet wide at its broad end, and 9
feet long. In the passage, as well as in the chamber,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
there were human bones belonging to individuals who
had been buried in a crouching posture. Unfortunately,
as the remains have been scattered, it is impossible to
ascertain the exact number of the burials. I have,
however, restored one skull and examined seven frontal
bones, and other remains, which indicate that there were
at least twelve persons, varying in age from infancy to
full prime, buried in this tomb. In
addition to these, there is a large
box of bones in the possession of
the Rev. D.&nbsp;R. Thomas, as well
as other remains in other hands.
But although the exact number of
bodies interred cannot be made
out, there is full proof that there
were too many to have been deposited
at one time in so small a
cubic area; and therefore they
must have been deposited at different
times, as in the caves at
Perthi-Chwareu. There were no
remains of either wild or domestic
animals; and the only foreign
object was a small slightly chipped
flint pebble. From the remarkable
conformation of the nasal bones of
some of the skulls, it would seem likely that the burial-place
belonged to one family; but, for a reason (see
Notes on Human Remains, <a href="#Page_183">p. 183</a>) stated by Professor
Busk, this is by no means a certain inference.</p>

<p>The plan of the chamber and passage corresponds
with that of the long barrow of West Kennet, figured
in the “Crania Britannica,” and with that of the cromlech<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
of Le Creux des Fées, Guernsey, described by
Lieutenant Oliver.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> In the former of these the corpses
were buried in a contracted posture, along with flint
scrapers and fragments of rude pottery. In the latter
the original contents have disappeared. To speak in
general terms, the chamber and passage belong to the
class of tombs which Dr. Thurnam names “Long Barrows,”
and Professor Nilsson “Ganggräben,” and which
are found in Scandinavia and France, as well as in
Britain. And it is worthy of note that the partial
insulation of the chamber <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> (<a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>) from the passage <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>
by a slab (<i>c</i>), which does not reach up to the height
of the walls, is to be seen in similar tombs both in
Guernsey and in Brittany.</p>

<p>A second and larger chamber, composed of cave slabs
of limestone, was discovered in the same cairn in 1871
by the Rev. D.&nbsp;R. Thomas, and completely excavated by
him along with myself and the Rev. H.&nbsp;H. Winwood.
It was of a rudely triangular form, 10 feet long by 6
wide, traversed by a partition of slabs, and provided
with a narrow passage 10 feet long by 2 feet 6 in
width, opening to the north, and fenced off completely
from the chamber by a slab, as in the preceding case.
Both the chamber and the passage were full of human
remains of all ages, buried in a contracted posture;
the number of interments being far too great to have
allowed the bodies to have been deposited at one time.
From the former I identified the broken jaw of a roebuck
and remains of goat, a broken flint, and round
pebbles of quartz, while in the latter there were the teeth
and bones of the dog and the pig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Some of the tibiæ from both the chambers were
platycnemic, but that character was only to be recognized
in the older bones. The skulls, from the second
of the two chambers, agree so exactly with those from
the caves, that it is not necessary to add to the table
of measurements which Professor Busk has drawn up
(<a href="#list_171">p.&nbsp;171</a>).</p>

<h3 id="hdr_73"><i>Correlation of Chambered Tomb with Interments in the
Caves of Perthi-Chwareu and Cefn.</i></h3>

<p>Nor are we without evidence that the builders of
this cairn belonged to the same race as those who buried
their dead in the caves of Perthi-Chwareu and of Cefn.
The crania and the limb-bones are identical, and in both
the tombs and caves the dead were buried in a contracted
posture.</p>

<p>Why then, it may be asked, were the remains of
animals so rare in the one and so abundant in the
other? In my opinion this difference may be explained
by the hypothesis, invented by Professor Nilsson, of the
origin of chambered tombs.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> The idea of the “gallery
graves,” according to that high authority, was derived
from the subterranean house in which the deceased
lived, and in which he was buried after his death, after
the fashion of the Eskimos at the present day. The plan
of the houses, like that of the ancient Lycian dwellings
described by Sir Charles Fellowes, was preserved in the
tombs, and probably for many ages after houses were no
longer made in that fashion; since the principle of conservatism
and the force of custom are more deeply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
rooted in religious and solemn ceremonial than in the
changes of every-day life.</p>

<p>The rarity of the remains of the animals may be
explained by the fact of these tombs never having been
used as dwellings, while their abundance in the caves
may be accounted for by the latter having been inhabited
by man, and thus the idea of the dead resting in his
own house would be the cause of burial both in caves
and chambered tombs. It is not at all strange that the
same race should have used both for sepulture, when we
consider that a “gallery grave” is an artificial cave, and
that natural caves are few in number.</p>

<p>This ancient race is proved by the remains to have
been pastoral, rather than dependent on the chase, their
principal food being the domestic goat, the short-horn
(<i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>), the horse, and hog. They are also
proved to have been neolithic, not merely by the discovery
of a polished stone axe in one of the caves, but
also by the shape of the “gallery graves,” which Professor
Nilsson and Dr. Thurnam agree in referring to
that stage of culture.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_74"><i>Table of Contents of Caves and Chambered Tomb.</i></h3>

<p>The contents of the caves and the stone chambers
may be gathered from the Table which we give on
the next page.</p>

<p>The broken bones of the hare prove that there was no
prejudice against its flesh, as was the case among the
neolithic dwellers in the Swiss Pfahlbauten. We shall
see in the next chapter that the animal was also eaten
by the dwellers in the neolithic caves both of France
and Belgium.</p>

<p>For the following account of the human remains, reprinted
from the “Journal of the Ethnological Society,”
January 1871, I am indebted to the kindness of my
friend Professor Busk, to whom examples of all the

<h4><i>Notes on the Human Remains.</i> By Professor <span class="smcap">Busk</span>, F.R.S.</h4>

<h5>§ 1. <span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h5>

<p>The remains discovered in the sepulchral cave at Perthi-Chwareu,
according to a list furnished by Mr. Boyd Dawkins, are as under; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
I believe this catalogue does not include all that were found in the
locality.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>1. Eleven more or less perfect skulls, some, however, represented
by mere fragments.</p>

<p>2. Twelve mandibles.</p>

<p>3. Seven arm-bones or <i class="anatomy">humeri</i>&mdash;four right and three left.</p>

<p>4. Six <i class="anatomy">ulnæ</i>.</p>

<p>5. Twenty-two thigh-bones, including five pairs, five odd ones of
the right side, and seven of the left; and amongst them are three of
very young children.</p>

<p>6. Seventeen <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i> or leg-bones, nine of the right and eight of the
left side, and apparently none of them in pairs; so that there must
probably have been a good many more.</p>

<p>7. Eight <i class="anatomy">astragali</i>.</p>

<p>8. Nine <i class="anatomy">calcanea</i>, or heel-bones.</p>

<p>The number of individuals, therefore, whose relics were deposited
in this cavern could not have been less than sixteen, and may have
been many more. They appear to have been of all ages and of
both sexes.</p>

<p>Of the other bones of the skeleton, of which there must have been
abundance, I have received no information.</p>

<p>In the Cefn Cave there were <span class="locked">discovered:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0 in4">
1. One mandible.<br />
2. One <i class="anatomy">humerus</i>.<br />
3. Two <i class="anatomy">ulnæ</i>.<br />
4. A pair of thigh-bones.<br />
5. A pair of leg-bones.
</p>

<p class="in0">and in the <span class="locked">tumulus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0 in4">
1. Portions of seven skulls.<br />
2. Two right <i class="anatomy">humeri</i>.<br />
3. A pair of <i class="anatomy">ulnæ</i>.<br />
4. A right <i class="anatomy">femur</i>.
</p>

<p>From St. Asaph the only bone that has come under my observation
is a single <i class="anatomy">calvaria</i>.</p>

<h5>§ 2. <span class="smcap">Description of the Bones from the Cavern at
Perthi-Chwareu.</span></h5>

<p>(a.) <i>General Condition.</i>&mdash;In general condition, as regards colour and
texture, these bones present some, but no very striking, differences;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
on the whole they are much alike, though it might be supposed that
some have lain longer in the ground than the others. One or
two among them (but these are apparently the younger bones) are
fragile; the majority, however, are as firm as common churchyard
bones, and some have quite the natural degree of hardness. They are
of a lightish-yellow colour, do not adhere to the tongue, and afford
scarcely any earthy smell when breathed upon or moistened: only
one among them presents any staining from oxide of manganese; and
this exists in diffuse blotches, and is not at all of the dendritic form.
Many are partially covered with a very thin film of crystalline
carbonate of lime.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 40, 41, 42.</span>&mdash;Skull from Sepulchral Cave at Perthi-Chwareu.</div></div>

<p>(b.) <i>The Skulls.</i>&mdash;Of these only three of the more perfect have come
under my observation. These alone will form the subject of what I
have to remark on this portion of the skeleton. But in the subjoined
Table&nbsp;I. (p.&nbsp;171) I have given, together with the dimensions of these
three, those of five others which have been furnished to me by
Mr. Dawkins.</p>

<p>In the specimen No. 1 (Figs 40, 41, 42) the entire facial part is
wanting, together with the whole of the base and a great part of one
side of the <i class="anatomy">calvaria</i>. The skull is of an oval form, symmetrical, with
a rather prominent occiput. The region of the vertex is slightly and
evenly arched; and the forehead, though not high, is vertical, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
slightly compressed on the sides. The sutures are all open and finely
serrated. The frontal sinuses are distinct though small. The supra-orbital
ridge is thin, but rather prominent towards the external angular
process. The mastoid processes are very large, and the digastric
<i class="anatomy">fossa</i> remarkably deep. The occipital spine is very prominent, as are
the lateral ridges. The temporal ridges, also, and, in short, all the
muscular impressions, are very strongly marked.</p>

<p>The skull is evidently that of a powerful, muscular man, in the
prime of life, and apparently of robust, but not coarse build.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<div id="Fig_43" class="figcenter" style="width: 524px;">
  <img src="images/i_169.jpg" width="524" height="466" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 43, 44, 45.</span>&mdash;Skull from Sepulchral Cave at Perthi-Chwareu.</div></div>

<p>Skull No. 2 (<a href="#Fig_43">Figs. 43, 44, 45</a>) is that of an adult male, presenting
as nearly as possible the same dimensions, form, and other characters
as that above described, except that the bone is somewhat thicker and
heavier. The muscular ridges and impressions are even more strongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
developed than in the former, and especially the temporal ridges
immediately above the external angular processes. The left <i class="anatomy">maxilla</i>
remains loosely attached, containing the two bicuspid teeth, which are
of small size, and worn quite flat, and to such an extent as to render
it probable that the man was somewhat advanced in years, although
none of the sutures are closed. The face is strictly orthognathous, and
the skull dolichocephalic and aphanozygous.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>Skull No. 3 is the entire <i class="anatomy">calvaria</i> of a very young individual. The
two milk-molars remain on either side; and behind them the first
true molar is fully out, but not in the least worn. The incisors and
canines have fallen out. The former, from the size of the <i class="anatomy">alveoli</i>,
were of the permanent set, but not the latter. The age of the
individual, therefore, may be estimated as about seven or eight.</p>

<p>The only point worthy of notice in this <i class="anatomy">calvaria</i> is the existence of
a well-marked depression across the middle of the occipital bone,
which appears exactly as if it had been caused by the constriction of
a bandage. The depression barely extends beyond the lambdoidal
suture into the parietals. It requires, perhaps, some imagination to
perceive the slight traces of a corresponding depression in the forepart
of the skull; but I think a faint depression may be there perceived
on careful inspection. The effect of the occipital constriction,
if it be such, reminds one of some of the deformed French skulls
described by M. Foville<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> and by M. Gosse.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> In all other respects the
skull is well formed and symmetrical. It is strictly orthognathous,
and of a broad oval shape.</p>

<p>If deformed artificially, it would come under the head of “tête
annulaire” of M. Gosse; and Dr. Foville shows that this kind of
deformation arises from the popular custom of applying a kind of
bandage round the head of the new-born infant, which, passing over
the anterior fontanelle, descends obliquely, and is crossed behind the
occiput and brought back and tied in front. This band, or “serre-tête,”
he states, is worn during the first year, and for a longer period
by female children than by males. Dr. Lunier gives pretty nearly the
same account, adding, however, further particulars.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> It may be
remarked, also, that the Berbers, who formed great part of the Moorish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
forces that invaded Europe in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries,
used to elongate the skull posteriorly and flatten the forehead.</p>

<p>(c.) <i>Thigh-bones.</i>&mdash;I have had an opportunity of examining only a
single perfect specimen of the thigh-bones. This is an entire bone,
18·2 inches long, with a least circumference of 3·5. Its perimetral
index<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> consequently is ·192, which is about the normal standard. The
<i class="anatomy">linea aspera</i>, at the middle of the bone more especially, is very
prominent, so that the bone may be termed, in some degree, carinated
(<a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>). The shaft is straight; and the chief peculiarities, besides
the prominent <i class="anatomy">linea aspera</i>, which it presents, are (1) an unusual
compression in the antero-posterior direction in the upper part, for the
extent of about three inches below the <i class="anatomy">trochanter minor</i>. At about
two inches below that process, or at a point corresponding with the
lower part of the insertion of the <i class="anatomy">pectineus</i> muscle, the shaft measures
·9 × 1·45, whilst in three other ordinary <i class="anatomy">femora</i>
with which I have compared it, the bone at
the corresponding part measures ·9 × 1·20,
·9 × 1·10, ·9 × 1·15, showing that the Perthi-Chwareu
<i class="anatomy">femur</i> is unusually expanded laterally
in the upper part of the shaft. The consequence
is to give the bone at that part a peculiar
aspect, which is especially seen in an acute
internal angle, and one rather less acute externally,
instead of the usually rounded internal
and external borders. (2) The distal extremity
appears to be rather disproportionately
large as compared with a recent well-formed bone of the same
length, the condyles measuring 2·5 × 3·3 instead of 2·4 × 3·05; and
the lower part of the shaft is also somewhat expanded. But the
chief peculiarity, as above remarked, is the compression of the shaft
in the upper part. Besides the <i class="anatomy">linea aspera</i>, all the muscular impressions
are strongly marked, and especially those for the insertion of
the <i class="anatomy">gluteus maximus</i> and the <i class="anatomy">trochanter minor</i>. The neck is long and
very oblique, and the head, upon which only a small portion of the
articular surface is left, must have had a diameter of about 1·9.</p>

<p>Mr. Boyd Dawkins has furnished me with the principal dimensions
of several other <i class="anatomy">femora</i>, varying in length from 16 to 18 inches, and
affording an average length of about 17, corresponding to a mean
height of the individuals of about 5 ft. 4 in. to 5 ft. 5 in., the tallest being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
perhaps 5 ft. 6 in., and the shortest about 5 ft. 2 in., no doubt a woman.
The mean perimetral index of the eight <i class="anatomy">femora</i> is ·186, which shows, in
comparison with the usual thickness of well-formed male thigh-bones
of the present day, a certain degree of slenderness. That this is not
altogether owing to the circumstance that the bones include those of
perhaps more than one female is proved by the fact that in no
instance does the perimetral index exceed ·192, and in one thigh-bone,
18″·2 long, it is not more, if the circumference is correctly given, than
·178, the normal perimetral index for the adult male <i class="anatomy">femur</i> in this
country being taken as about ·194.</p>

<p>(d.) <i class="anatomy">Tibiæ.</i>&mdash;Of the leg-bones brought under my notice, five are
entire and five more or less defective. The principal dimensions and
proportions of these bones, so far as they could be taken, are given in
the subjoined Table.</p>

<p>In this Table the <em>length</em> means the extreme length of the bone as
measured from the summit of the spinous process to the point of the
internal malleolus; and the numbers in the fifth column represent the
antero-posterior and the transverse diameter of the shaft at the point
where the popliteal line terminates at the inner border of the bone,
which is usually about an inch and a half below the nutritive
foramen. The <em>latitudinal</em> index represents the relation that the
transverse diameter bears to the antero posterior, and it is employed
to indicate, with some degree of precision, the actual amount of
compression or flattening of the shaft as compared with the normal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>

<p>Comparison of the mean proportions given in the two Tables
<span class="locked">shows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) That the Perthi-Chwareu leg-bones are, on the whole, shorter,
and absolutely smaller in all dimensions but one, viz. in the antero-posterior
diameter of the shaft, which, notwithstanding the smaller
size generally of the bones, is rather greater (that is to say, in the
proportion of 129 to 126) than in the ordinary run of English <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i>.</p>

<p>(2) That their perimetral index is greater, showing that, in proportion
to their length, the Welsh bones are somewhat thicker, or in
the proportion of 211 to 188.</p>

<p>(3) But the most marked difference is seen in the latitudinal index,
which in the Perthi-Chwareu bones is ·611, and in those of the
ordinary type ·730, varying in the former case from ·538 to ·700, and
in the latter from ·642 to ·850; but the last is probably an exceptional
case. In accordance with this, we find that the mean transverse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
diameter of the shaft at the point above indicated is greatly under
the usual mark, viz. as 79 to 91.</p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the Perthi-Chwareu <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i> are more compressed
or flattened than the usual run of modern European <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i>; in
other words, they belong to the platycnemic type.</p>

<p>As this is, I believe, the first instance in which the occurrence of
<i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i> of this peculiar conformation has been observed in this country,
the circumstance is of some interest, especially with relation to the
occurrence of priscan bones of the same type elsewhere.</p>

<p>This peculiar conformation of the <i class="anatomy">tibia</i>, to which we gave the name
of “platycnemic,” was, I believe, first noticed by Dr. Falconer and
myself, in 1863, in the human remains procured by Captain Brome
from the Genista Cave, on Windmill Hill, Gibraltar, of which
an account will be found in the Transactions of the International
Congress of Prehistoric Archæology for the year 1868 (p.&nbsp;161); and
about the same time, or in May 1864, M. Broca<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> independently
observed the same condition in <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i> procured from the dolmen of
Chamant (Oise), and afterwards in bones from the dolmen of
Maintenon (Eure-et-Loire). Similar bones have since been noticed in
other localities on the Continent, as, for instance, in the diluvium of
Montmartre, by M. Eugène Bertrand. But that the peculiarity in
question is not common in all the varieties of priscan man belonging
to the reindeer period is shown by the fact that it has not been
observed in any of the <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i> exhumed by M. Dupont in the Belgian
caves.</p>

<p>M. Broca’s almost exhaustive remarks upon the anatomical, physiological,
and pathological relations of this form of <i class="anatomy">tibia</i> leave but little
to be said under those heads. I would, however, venture to add a few
words as to its ethnological significance. But before doing so I would
remark that there appear to be two forms of platycnemism, apparently
indicative of some difference in the cause or nature of this aberration
from the more usual shape of the bone. To save many words, I
subjoin outlines of several well-marked instances of platycnemic bones,
all drawn of the natural size and in the same position, the letter (<i>a</i>)
in each corresponding to the interosseous ridge, and (<i>b</i>) to the <i class="anatomy">crista</i>
or shin.</p>

<p>The line <i>b c</i>, drawn through the <i class="anatomy">crista</i> and the middle of the
posterior surface of the bone, is bisected by another (<i>a d</i>), drawn at
right angles to it, at the level of the interosseous ridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
In <a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a>, which represents what may be regarded as a normal
<i class="anatomy">tibia</i>, the length of that portion of the antero-posterior line which is
behind the transverse line is to that of the anterior as 274 to 1,000,
whilst in <a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 48</a>, taken from M. Broca’s outline of the Cro-magnon
<i class="anatomy">tibia</i>, which would seem to represent the extremest degree of platycnemism
as yet observed, the proportion in question is as 623 to 1,000.</p>

<div id="Fig_47" class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 49, 50, 51.</span></div></div>

<p>Figs. 49, 50, 51, are taken from as many of the Gibraltar <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i>,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> in
which the proportion varies from 600 to 523, whilst it will be observed
that in <a href="#Fig_52">Figs. 52, 53, 54</a>, taken from the most platycnemic of the Perthi-Chwareu
<i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i>, the proportion in one only differs in any considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
degree from the extreme normal proportion shown in <a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a>; and in
this it is as 512 to 1,000, whilst in <a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 53</a>, which is nevertheless
undoubtedly platycnemic, the proportion is exactly the same as in the
most triangular form of bone.</p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, that platycnemism may arise from an
unusual antero-posterior expansion of the bone, either in front or
behind the level of the interosseous ridge. What this difference may
indicate, or of what importance it may be in the consideration of
questions relating to platycnemism, I am not prepared to discuss; but
as in all probability it is connected with a difference in the cause of
the deformation (if it be deformation), I have thought that the
observation should be recorded, and would merely, in addition, remark
that, so far as I have noticed, the occasional and not infrequent
platycnemism observed in the shin-bones of negroes is what may be
termed anterior.</p>

<div id="Fig_52" class="figcenter" style="width: 494px;">
  <img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="494" height="255" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 52, 53, 54.</span></div></div>

<p>With respect to the ethnological value of the platycnemic <i class="anatomy">tibia</i>, I conceive
we are as yet very much in the dark. That it is a race-character
would seem to me in the highest degree improbable, seeing that it
would be difficult to find any other points of resemblance between the
Cro-magnon platycnemic men and those whose remains were met with
in the Gibraltar caves, although the platycnemism is of the same
kind in each; and still less could the former gigantic race be identified
with the occupants of the Perthi-Chwareu sepulchre, from whom they
differ not only in stature, but even more remarkably in cranial
conformation.</p>

<p>If, then, platycnemism cannot be regarded as of any value as a
race-character, it can <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a fortiori</i> be still less looked upon as indicative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
of simian tendencies, a notion that M. Broca seems somewhat inclined
to favour. It is quite true that the <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i> of the gorilla and of the
chimpanzee are, to a certain extent, platycnemic; but it is by no
means so much so as the human platycnemic bone. The <i class="anatomy">tibia</i> of a
male gorilla in the College of Surgeons has a latitudinal index of ·681,
and that of a female of ·650, whilst that of the chimpanzee is ·611,
or exactly the mean of the Perthi-Chwareu bones. It is needless to
insist upon the other marked distinctions between the simian and the
human <i class="anatomy">tibia</i>; but as regards platycnemism it will be obvious, if we
are disposed to trace it to any genetic descent, that the descendant
has, in this respect, at one time far out-simianized the Simiæ.</p>

<p>But this comparison with the anthropoid apes may, perhaps, afford
ground for a suggestion respecting some possible connection between
this peculiar form of the <i class="anatomy">tibia</i> and the habits of the people amongst
whom it has been observed. One great distinction between the
human and the simian foot consists in their respective adaptations to
totally distinct functions. In the one case it is simply an organ of
support and progression; in the other, for the most part, of prehension.
This necessarily involves a considerable difference in the proportions,
&amp;c., of the muscles by which the greater mobility and adaptability of
the foot, and more particularly of the digits, are ensured. Would it
not, then, be admissible to inquire how far, at any rate, posterior
platycnemism may be connected with the greater freedom of motion
and general adaptability of the toes enjoyed by those peoples whose
feet have not been subjected to the confinement of shoes or other
coverings, and who at the same time have been compelled to lead an
active existence in a rude and rugged or mountainous and wooded
country, where the exigencies of the chase would demand the utmost
agility in climbing and otherwise?</p>

<p>Some common cause of this kind would seem to be not improbable;
and it would not, perhaps, be difficult to ascertain whether it is a
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vera causa</i> or not. But, with respect to this, observations are at
present wanting.</p>

<p>From the foregoing data we may <span class="locked">conclude:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) That the Perthi-Chwareu bones belonged to a race characterized
by the proportionally rather large dimensions of the cranium, whose
form presents nothing very remarkable, and is pretty nearly conformable
to several of those found by Mr. Laing in the ancient
shell-mounds in Shetland.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span><a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>(2) That this form is distinctly different from that of the Mewslade
skull, in which the vertical region is somewhat flattened, as is the
case also with several Anglesey crania, which, however, appear to
pass, by gradual transition, into the Keiss and Perthi-Chwareu shape,
through such a form as that of the Towyn-y-capel skull figured by
Professor Huxley;<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> and the whole of them consequently may be
regarded as belonging to the so-called “River-bed skulls” of that
author, excepting the Borris cranium, which appears to belong to a
different type altogether.</p>

<p>(3) That the people whose remains were found in this locality were
of low stature (the mean height, deduced from the lengths of the
long bones, being little more than 5 feet), the tallest being 5 ft. 6 in.,
and the shortest adult not more than 4 ft. 10 in., the intermediate
ones being 5 ft. 1 in. and 5 ft. 2 in.</p>

<p>(4) That the proportions of the long bones are rather thick, and
the muscular impressions in all are very strongly marked.</p>

<p>(5) That the <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i> are, for the most part, of a much more compressed
form than those of the modern English, but that this platycnemism
does not appear to be exactly of the same kind as that which
is exhibited in the Gibraltar bones and in those from Cro-magnon (as
figured by M. Broca), the difference consisting in the fact that in the
two latter instances the bone is expanded backwards behind the
transverse plane at the interosseous ridge as much as it is in front of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
that plane, whilst in the Welsh <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i> it is the anterior portion of the
shaft only which is expanded; or, in other words, the platycnemism
in them is due simply to an absolute compression of the shaft.</p>

<h5>§ 3. <span class="smcap">Human Remains from the Cefn Tumulus.</span></h5>

<p>These remains, as submitted to my inspection, consist <span class="locked">of:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) Portions of three frontal bones, two of which are nearly complete,
and one constituted of little more than the superciliary region.</p>

<p>(2) Two parietals and a left temporal, probably belonging to the
same skull as the more mutilated frontal.</p>

<p>(3) Portions of four thigh-bones, two left and two right, one of
the latter wanting the proximal, the other both extremities.</p>

<p>We have thus the remains of three individuals from this interment.</p>

<p>I. <i>The Frontal Bones.</i>&mdash;No. 1. The least transverse diameter,
immediately behind the external angular processes, is 3″·6, and its
greatest (at the coronal suture) about 4″·3. Longitudinal arc, 4″·1.
The profile outline of the forehead is slightly receding; the frontal
sinuses moderately developed; and the supraorbital border thin and
acute, whilst the glabellar eminence is large and prominent. The
bone is a good deal compressed on the sides, so as to have almost the
appearance of having formed part of a cymbecephalic skull. The
bone itself is thin, and probably without any <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">diploë</i>.</p>

<p>No. 2 presents exactly the same characters, except that the longitudinal
arc is greater, being 5″·3. The postorbital or least transverse
diameter is 3″·4, and the coronal or greatest 4″·4. The frontal
sinuses are well developed; the supraorbital ridge rather prominent,
but thin and sharp; the external angular process prominent and
thick. Glabellar eminence large and prominent. The nasals remain
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i>, and project almost, if not quite, horizontally forwards, with a
rapid curve at first, and then straight out. The general contour of
the bone is exactly like that of No. 1, in which also, although the
nasals are wanting, the position of the surface by which they were
attached shows that they must in all probability have resembled those
of No. 2. The <i class="anatomy">crista galli</i> of the ethmoid, which is left <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i>, is
remarkably thick and high.</p>

<p>No. 3 is a portion of a larger and wider bone, the postorbital
diameter being at least 4″·0. The frontal sinuses are very large, but
distinctly defined, as the remainder of the supraorbital border is not
thickened. Owing perhaps to the greater prominence of the sinuses,
the glabella does not appear so protuberant as in the other instances.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
The nasal bones remain and project forwards in the same curious
fashion as in No. 2. The frontal crest on the inner surface is
remarkably developed, being at least half an inch high, though it is
separated by a wide notch from the equally strongly developed <i class="anatomy">crista
galli</i> of the ethmoid.</p>

<p>No. 4, when the three bones of which it is composed are put
together, consists of the greater part of the parietal region of the
skull, to which, as before said, the last-described frontal may have
belonged. The left parietal is quite perfect; and a considerable
portion of the right also remains, together with the entire left
temporal; so that a very sufficient estimate of the proportions of the
parietal region of the skull can be obtained.</p>

<p>As well as can be estimated, the parietal longitudinal arc, or length
of the sagittal suture, is 5″·2. The vertical transverse arc, or that
drawn from one auditory foramen to the other, over the point of
junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures, is 12″·2, the parietal
13″, and the occipital 12″·2. In the temporal bone, the external
auditory foramen is large, the mastoid process of moderate size, but
the digastric fossa is wide and deep. The channels for the middle
meningeal artery and its branches are large and deep; and very deep
depressions on the sides of the sagittal suture show that the <i class="anatomy">glandulæ
Pacchioni</i> must have been greatly developed. The bone is very thin,
and with scarcely a trace of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">diploë</i> where its structure is visible.
None of the sutures, however, which are strongly serrated, are in the
slightest degree closed, although, as I should imagine, the skull must
have been that of a man beyond the middle period of life.</p>

<p>II. <i>The Thigh-bones.</i>&mdash;Two of these bones, which, though much
alike, differ sufficiently to show that they did not belong to the same
individual, are decidedly carinate.</p>

<p>No. 1 wants the upper and lower ends. The least circumference of
the shaft, which is at a point about 3½ inches below the <i class="anatomy">trochanter
minor</i>, is 3″·2. That process, as well as all the other muscular impressions,
is strongly developed; and that for the insertion of the <i class="anatomy">gluteus
maximus</i> is peculiar in presenting the form of a deep elongated pit
instead of a roughened elevation as usual. The antero-posterior and
transverse diameters of the shaft, about 1½ inches below the <i class="anatomy">trochanter
minor</i>, are ·85 × 1·4; and the shaft at this part, like that of the above-described
from Perthi-Chwareu, presents a rather acute or narrow
external and internal border instead of the usual more rounded form.
Lower down, the shaft becomes strongly carinate; and, owing to the
flattened form of the anterior surface, its transverse section affords a
subtriangular figure (<a href="#Fig_55">fig. 55</a>). The walls, or cortical substance, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
rather thicker than usual, and the substance of the bone is dense
and hard.</p>

<div id="Fig_55" class="figleft" style="width: 142px;">
  <img src="images/i_182.jpg" width="142" height="130" alt="" />

  <img src="images/i_182b.jpg" width="147" height="155" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 56.</span></div></div>

<p>No. 2 is very similar in character to the foregoing, but is not quite
so much compressed in the upper part, measuring ·8 × 1·2. Nevertheless
the inner border is very acute, and the outer more so than in
the common form of <i class="anatomy">femur</i>. The shaft lower down is not so strongly
carinate as it is in the former instance, but is still so in some degree
(<a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>); and the walls (or cortical substance) are still thicker in
proportion.</p>

<div id="Fig_57" class="figleft" style="width: 145px;">
  <img src="images/i_182c.jpg" width="145" height="130" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.</span></div></div>

  <img src="images/i_182d.jpg" width="146" height="165" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span></div></div>

<p>No. 3. A third specimen consists of the lower half, or rather more,
of the right <i class="anatomy">femur</i>. The least circumference is 3″·2. The bone exhibits
no special external characters, and is in no degree carinated.
The shaft, at about the middle of its length, is somewhat angular in
front; and the pit for the origin of the <i class="anatomy">popliteus</i> muscle is deeper and
perhaps larger than in most bones of the same size. The texture of
the cortical substance is quite eburneous; and it is extremely thick,
so that the medullary canal is reduced to a calibre of little more than
0″·25 in its longest diameter. The shaft, however, is straight, and
exhibits no other sign whatever of having been affected with <i class="anatomy">rachitis</i>.
It is, however, a curious circumstance that many of the Gibraltar
thigh-bones, most of which are carinate, present the same thickening
of the cortical substance (<a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
No. 4. A fourth specimen is constituted of merely a portion of the
shaft, about 12 inches long, and without either extremity. Its least
diameter is 3″·3, and its antero-posterior and transverse diameters, at
the same point as in the other bones, 1 × 1·25, or pretty nearly in
the usual proportions. Nevertheless the bone, throughout its whole
remaining extent, is less rounded on the inner side of the shaft than
is usual. The <i class="anatomy">trochanter minor</i> is of gigantic size; and the shaft of
the bone, about and below the middle, exhibits a subtriangular aspect
(<a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a>), though scarcely to be called carinate. The cortical substance
is of the normal thickness.</p>

<p>III. <i class="anatomy">Tibiæ.</i>&mdash;No. 1 consists of the greater portion of the left tibia,
wanting only the lower extremity. The proximal end measures 2·9
× 1·9; and the diameters of the shaft, about the middle, are 1·2 ×
·75, giving a latitudinal index of ·620. The shin is remarkably sharp
and prominent, and rather curved over to the outer side; and the
apparent compression or tendency to platycnemism may in some
measure be referred more to the production in front of the anterior
part of the bone than to actual narrowing of the posterior side of the
triangle, which is nevertheless rather more rounded than in most
cases. The axis of the shaft is quite straight; and the bone has not
the least rickety appearance.</p>

<p>No. 2 is also a portion of the left tibia. Both extremities are
wanting, and the bone offers nothing worthy of remark. Its least
circumference is 2″·65; and the shaft, at the middle, measures 1″·1
× ·65; so that the latitudinal index is about ·640, showing a slight
degree of compression. The entire length of the bone may be estimated
as rather more than 13 inches, corresponding to a height of
about 5 ft. 4 in. or 5 ft. 5 in., so that the subject may be supposed to
have been a female.</p>

<p>These remains represent at least four individuals&mdash;one probably
somewhat aged, another of strong and robust make, and one, in
all probability, a woman&mdash;in fact, a family group. No correct idea
can be formed of the cranial conformation of these persons. In
general shape it would seem to correspond with that of the Perthi-Chwareu
skulls; but two of them at any rate are of smaller size, if
we may judge from the least frontal diameter. The forehead also is
perhaps a little more reclined. The most striking feature in two of
the specimens, and which appears also to have existed in a third, is
the extraordinary projection forwards of the nasal bones. In the
present case this may probably be regarded as a family peculiarity;
but with reference to it, it should be remembered that M. Broca<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
described a very similar condition in the skull of the “Old man” of
Cro-magnon, in whom, he says, “the ridge of the nose, slightly
depressed at its base, rises again almost immediately, and advances
boldly forward, making a rapid curve, with the concavity directed
rather forward and especially upward, so that the lower ends of the
<i class="anatomy">ossa nasi</i> are placed 18 mm. (·7 inch) in front of a line dropped
vertically from the fronto-nasal suture.”</p>

<p>The condition of the bones from the Cefn tumulus differs very
considerably from that of the remains from Perthi-Chwareu. They
all have an appearance of much greater antiquity. With the exception
of the very dense <i class="anatomy">femur</i>, they adhere to the tongue; and they are all
deeply stained with manganous oxide, by which the substance even
of the hardest portions is stained to a depth of more than one-eighth
of an inch. That this discoloration, which for the most part does
not assume the dendritic appearance, is due to manganese and not to
any vegetable stain, is quite certain.</p>

<p>The form of the skull, so far as it can be ascertained from such
imperfect remains, and the rather platycnemic shape of the <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i>, may
perhaps justify our supposing that the Cefn bones belong to a
cognate race to those whose remains were deposited at Perthi-Chwareu,
or to one which had lived under similar conditions. But the cranial
data are hardly sufficient to allow of any satisfactory inference being
drawn from them: and as regards the <i class="anatomy">tibiæ</i>, it has already been
pointed out that platycnemism cannot, in the present state of our
knowledge, be regarded as an important ethnological character amongst
priscan peoples, though it may undoubtedly be considered a character
betokening remote antiquity.</p>

<h5>§ 4. <span class="smcap">Skull from the Cefn Cave, near St. Asaph.</span></h5>

<p>The only specimen of human remains from this locality is a nearly
entire <i class="anatomy">calvaria</i>, wanting the whole of the face below the superciliary
border.</p>

<p>In the middle of the left parietal bone is a small irregular opening,
with short radiating lines of fracture proceeding from it; but this
appears to have been recently caused, and from the inside.</p>

<p>The bone generally is of a brown colour, and, as regards firmness,
in a natural condition; and it does not adhere to the tongue. Judging
from its aspect alone, it would not appear to be of any very great
antiquity; but as it has lain in a dry soil, and sheltered from rain or
moisture, this appearance may be deceptive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Its dimensions are given in <a href="#list_171">Table I</a>. (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">supra</i>), from which it will be
seen that the cephalic or latitudinal index is ·770, and the altitudinal
·702. It belongs, therefore, to the category of subbrachy-cephalic
skulls of Thurnam and Professor Huxley.</p>

resembles, except in one respect, that described and figured by Professor
Huxley (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">loc. cit.</i> p. 125, <a href="#Fig_59">Figs. 60, 61</a>) from the bed of the Nore, at Borris,
in Ireland, that we can scarcely refuse to recognize a common character
between them, which, since in the present case it cannot be looked upon
as denoting a mere family relationship, may reasonably be regarded as
indicative of some affinity of race. The chief difference observable
in this view of the two skulls is the greater development of the frontal
sinuses in the Borris <i class="anatomy">calvaria</i>. The occipital view (<i class="anatomy">norma occipitalis</i>,
Fig. 8 is also very similar, except that in the Borris skull the greatest
width appears to be in the temporal, and in the other the parietal
region. In the Borris skull, also, there is a shallow groove in the
course of the sagittal suture, which does not exist in that from
St. Asaph.</p>

<p>The Borris skull is said to be of the extraordinary length of 8
inches; and this may account for the much lower cephalic index of
the skull, whose absolute width in reality somewhat exceeds the Cefn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
specimen (5″·9 and 5″·7), whilst the altitudinal as compared with the
latitudinal is but very little greater than it would be were the skulls
reduced to the same breadth. They may both, therefore, be regarded
as “low,” or, as this class of skull might be termed, in the euphonious
language of craniologists, “tapinocephalic.” One great peculiarity
of the Cefn <i class="anatomy">cranium</i> (which exists also, but apparently not to quite
so great a degree, in the other) is the absolute horizontality of the
plane of the subinial portion of the occipital bone. And it is to
this flattening that the comparative lowness may perhaps be chiefly
attributed.</p>

<p>The sutures, where visible, appear to be open. The mastoid
processes and all other muscular impressions are strongly marked.</p>

<p>A third skull of very similar character, except that it is not so much
depressed, has come under my observation. It was discovered in a
submarine or, rather, subterranean peat-bed or ancient forest, 30 feet
below the sea-level, at Sennen, near the Land’s End, in Cornwall;
and a brief notice and outline figure of it will be found in the
“Natural History Review” for 1861.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> The Sennen skull has the
same elongated form; but it is higher than either the Cefn, St.
Asaph, or Borris crania, having an altitudinal index of ·730.</p>

<p>On the whole, these three skulls (<i>i.e.</i> those from Borris, Sennen,
and St. Asaph) would appear to have a common character, and to be of
a different type from either the Perthi-Chwareu or the Mewslade form.</p>

<p>As a rule it may, I think, be stated that in all brachy-cephalic skulls
the breadth exceeds the height, whilst the reverse is the case in the
dolicho-cephalic. Individual exceptions are of course not unfrequently
met with, more especially among very mixed races, such as the modern
English; but I am myself acquainted with only two dolicho-cephalic
<em>races</em>, properly so termed, in which the rule does not hold good. These
are the Tasmanian (not Australian) and the Bushman.</p>

<p>Any exceptions, therefore, to either rule among ancient and, consequently,
less mixed races are worthy of being noted.</p>

<p>As regards modern brachy-cephalic skulls the law holds almost
universally, the only marked exception, except in an individual here
and there, being in two Karén skulls, in which, although both
decidedly brachy-cephalic, the respective indices stand as ·848 to ·924,
and as ·790 to ·842.</p>

<p>Among priscan brachy-cephalic skulls the most remarkable and
important exceptions I have met with occur among the neolithic crania
in the Copenhagen Museum, more than half of which are brachy-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>cephalic,
and most of the others nearly so, the mean cephalic index of 21
skulls being ·790, whilst the mean altitudinal is as high as ·810. In
fact, out of 12 skulls whose indices vary from ·795 to ·838, no fewer
than 10 have the latitudinal index less than the altitudinal.</p>

<p>The exceptions to the rule as applied to dolicho-cephalic skulls also
appear to be far more common among the ancient than among the
modern, excepting the two races I have above referred to.</p>

<p>In a long list of ancient and priscan skulls, I find the following
having the tapino-cephalic <span class="locked">character:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0">The number is but small, it must be confessed, and perhaps hardly
sufficient to do more than prove the rule; but still I think it will be
found worth inquiry whether a departure from the rule in question
was more frequent among the unmixed or little-mixed races of ancient
times than it is amongst similarly unmixed races of the present day;
and whether consequently its infraction in a considerable number
of instances may or may not be indicative of a lower type, as which
we are accustomed to regard the Tasmanian and Bushman races.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="hdr_76"><i>General Conclusions as to Human Remains.</i></h3>

<p>The human remains in the caves of Perthi-Chwareu
and Cefn, and in the cairn near the latter place, imply
that the men to which they belonged were a short race,
the tallest being about 5 feet 6 inches, and the shortest 4
feet 10 inches.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> Their skulls are orthognathic,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> or not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
presenting a lower jaw advancing beyond the vertical line
dropped from the forehead; in shape ortho-cephalic, or
subbrachy-cephalous, and of fair average capacity. The
face was oval and the cheek-bones were not prominent.
Some of the individuals were characterised by the
peculiar flattening of shin (platycnemism), which probably
stood in relation to the free action of the foot
that was not impeded by the use of a rigid sole or
sandal. This character, however, is neither peculiar to
race, nor to be viewed as a tendency towards the simian
type of leg. These conclusions, which Professor Busk
has arrived at from the examination of the remains
which were submitted to him, have been fully borne out
by the numerous skeletons which have been subsequently
discovered, both in the sepulchral caves at Rhosdigre
and in a second chamber in the cairn of Tyddyn Bleiddyn
near Cefn.</p>

<p>It has been objected that skull form is of no value
in determining race, because it varies so much at the
present time among the same peoples, presenting the
extremes of dolicho- and brachy-cephalism as well as
every kind of asymmetry. This, however, is due to our
very abnormal conditions of life, and to the mixture of
different races brought about by the needs of commerce,
as in Manchester and Vienna, as is pointed out by
Mr. Bradley.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>In prehistoric times, neither of these causes of variation
made themselves seriously felt. There was little, if any,
peaceful movement of races, but war was the normal
condition, and society was not sufficiently advanced to
remove man from the influence of his natural environment.
The objection may therefore be dismissed as not
applicable to the skulls in question.</p>

<p>The extent to which abnormal conditions of life are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
capable of modifying the shape of skulls may be gathered
from the comparison of the skull of an Irish hog with
that of its ancestor the wild-boar, or even that of a
hyæna kept in confinement with that of a wild animal
of the same species. (See Osteol. Series, Brit. Mus.)</p>

<h3 id="hdr_78"><i>The British Dolicho-cephali and Brachy-cephali.</i></h3>

<p>The materials for working out the craniology of
Europe, in prehistoric times, do not justify any sweeping
conclusion as to the distribution of the various races,
but those which Dr. Thurnam (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">op. cit.</i>) has collected
in Britain offer a firm basis for such an inquiry. In
the numerous long barrows and chambered “gallery
graves” of our island, which from the invariable absence
of bronze, and the frequent presence of polished stone
implements, may be referred to the neolithic age, the
crania belong, with scarcely an exception, to the first
two of these divisions. In the round barrows, on the
other hand, in which bronze articles are found, they
belong mainly to the third division, although some are
ortho-cephalous. Sometimes, as in the case of Tilshead,
the crania in the primary interment, over which the
long barrow was raised, are long, while those in the
secondary, which have been made after the heaping up
of the barrow, are broad.</p>

<p>On evidence of this kind Dr. Thurnam concludes, that
Britain was inhabited in the neolithic age by a long-headed
people, and that towards its close it was invaded
by a bronze-using race, who were dominant during the
bronze age. This important conclusion has been verified
by nearly every discovery which has been made in this
country since its publication. The long skulls graduate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
into the broad, the oval skulls being the intermediate
forms; and this would naturally result from the intermingling
of the blood of the two races. There may,
however, have been a tendency towards ortho-cephalism
in the dolicho-cephali, without any admixture of foreign
blood, since absolute unity of form could not be expected.</p>

<p>The skull of the primary interment in the barrow of
Winterbourne Stoke is taken by Dr. Thurnam as typical
of the dolicho-cephalic class. “The greatest length is
7·3 inches (the glabello-inial diameter 7·1 inches); the
greatest breadth is 5·5 inches, being in the proportion of
75 to the length taken as 100. The forehead is narrow
and receding, and moderately high in the coronal region,
behind which is a trace of transverse depression. The
parietal tubers are somewhat full, and add materially
to the breadth of this otherwise narrow skull. The
posterior borders of the parietals are prolonged backwards,
to join a complex chain of Wormian bones in the
line of the lambdoid suture. The superior scale of the
occiput is full, rounded, and prominent; the inion more
pronounced than usual in this class of dolicho-cephalic
skulls. The superciliaries are well marked, the orbits
rather small and long; the nasals prominent, the
facial bones short and small; the molars flat and almost
vertical; the alveolars short, but rather projecting. The
mandible is comparatively small, but angular; the chin
square, narrow, and prominent.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>Dolicho-cephalic skulls in general (and in part ortho-cephalic)
are possessed, according to Dr. Thurnam, of
the following characters (Vol. iii. p. 69):&mdash;“The supraciliary
ridges are less strongly marked than in the brachy-cephalic.
There is none of the prognathism, exaggerated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
malar breadth or great width of the nasal openings, which
give such an air of savageness and ferocity to the New
Caledonians and Caroline Islanders; but the very reverse
of all these. They are indeed more orthognathic even
than many Europeans, and the facial characters generally
are mild, and without exaggerated development in any
one direction.” Their faces are oval. The upper jaw is
small, and the sockets of the incisors and canine almost
vertical. The supra-occipital region is full and rounded,
and there is a post-coronal annular depression on the
skull, termed by Dr. Gosse “tête annulaire.” The
length is mainly due to the development of the occiput,
a condition that is termed by M. Broca “dolicho-cephalie
occipitale,” as distinguished from the “dolicho-cephalie
frontale” of other races. The teeth are worn flat. The
bones associated with the skulls of this character show
that the stature of the race was short, 5 feet 5 inches
being the average height.</p>

<p>In the brachy-cephalic, or broad skulls, on the other
hand, the supraciliary ridges are more strongly marked
than in the preceding group; the cheek-bones are high
and broad, the sockets for the front teeth are oblique,
and the mouth projects beyond the vertical dropped from
the forehead, presenting the character of prognathism.
The face, instead of being oval, is angular or lozenge-shaped.
On the back of the head the occipital tuberosity,
or probole, is the most prominent feature, and
there is also generally an occipital flattening, which may
have been caused by the use of an unyielding cradle-board
in infancy. The entire maxillary apparatus is so
largely developed, that the term “macrognathic,” introduced
by Professor Huxley, is particularly applicable
to them. The “type mongoloide” of Dr. Pruner-Bey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
is closely allied to, if not identical with, this form
of skull.</p>

<p>The stature of the British brachy-cephali is much
greater than that of the dolicho-cephali, the average for
the adult male being 5 feet 8·4 inches, according to Dr.
Thurnam.</p>

<p>The human remains from the caves and chambered-tombs
of Denbighshire belong to the first of these divisions,
in the possession of every one of the characters
assigned to it by Dr. Thurnam, although the crania
belong to the ortho-cephalous portion of the series, that
is, tending towards broad-headedness. It may therefore
be inferred that they belong to the same race as the
neolithic raisers of the long-barrows, a race which we
shall presently see to be identical with the ancient
Iberians and modern Basques.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_79"><i>The Range of the Dolicho-cephali in Britain and
Ireland.</i></h3>

<p>The same class of human remains has been obtained
from caves in other districts in Great Britain. In the
Oxford Museum a human skull, from the cave of Llandebie,
possesses cephalic index of ·72; while a second,
from the cave of Uphill in Somersetshire, explored by
Mr. James Parker in 1863, measures ·723. (See <a href="#Page_197">p. 197</a>.)
The latter was associated with rude pottery, charcoal,
and the remains of the following animals: the wild-cat,
dog, fox, badger, pig, stag, <i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>, goat, and
water-rat. Most of the remains belong to young individuals,
and some have been gnawed by dogs, wolves,
or foxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
In Yorkshire a human femur presenting an enormous
development of the linea aspera, which implies the
possession of the platycnemic character, has been met
with in a cave in King’s Scar, near Settle (see <a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>),
and fragments of a long skull are preserved in the
Museum at Leeds from that of Dowkerbottom.</p>

<p>Professor Turner has described<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> the remains found in
a cave in the Old Red sandstone on the shore of the bay
of Oban in 1869 by Mr. Mackay. There were two
human skeletons, along with the broken and burnt bones
of the roe and stag, limpet-shells, flint nodules, and flint
flakes. One of the leg-bones is platycnemic, and the
fragments of skull may probably be referred to the
dolicho-cephalic type.</p>

<p>The same type of skull has also been obtained by
the Rev. Canon Greenwell, from the neolithic tumuli of
Yorkshire, along with the same group of animals as in
the caves at Perthi-Chwareu, the <i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>, goat,
horse, dog, and stag; and Professor Rolleston, F.R.S.,
informs me that some of the associated human leg-bones
are platycnemic. It is also recognized by Professor
Huxley as identical with his river-bed type of skulls
from alluvial deposits near Muskham in the valley of
the Trent, Ledbury Hall in the valley of the Dove, and
in Ireland from the bed of the Nore in Queen’s County,
and from that of the river Blackwater. To it also
Professor Huxley refers<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> five or six out of the seven
skulls obtained by Mr. Laing from the stone cists in the
burial mound at Keiss in Caithness, and associated with
rude weapons and implements of bone and stone. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
probably belonged to the inhabitants of the neighbouring
burgh, or circular stone dwelling, in and around
which were the broken bones of the following animal
remains: the <i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>, goat, stag, hog, horse, dog,
fox, grampus or small whale, dolphin or some other
small cetacean, great auk (<i class="taxonomy">Alca impennis</i>, now extinct
in Europe), lesser auk, cormorant, shag, solan goose, cod,
lobster, and shell-fish. A lower jaw also of a child,
broken after the same manner as other refuse bones,
is considered by Professor Owen and Mr. Laing to prove
that human flesh was sometimes used for food. The
reindeer was living in the district at this time, since
its remains have been identified by Dr. Campbell from
the Harbour mound, one of the many refuse-heaps in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The same kind of skull is also described by Professor
Wilson under the name of “boat-shaped” or “kumbe-cephalic,”
from the ancient stone chambers and tumuli
of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>In the Table on the next page, showing the relative
size and shape of the more important long skulls of
Britain and Ireland, it will be seen that the extreme
long-headedness of those from the long barrows is
not possessed by those either of the caves and tombs of
Denbighshire or of the river-bed type of Huxley, represented
by the skulls from Muskham, Ledbury, Blackwater
(Ireland), and Keiss.</p>

<p>The greater breadth of the skulls from the caves and
tombs of Denbighshire, as compared with those of the
typical long skulls from the long barrows, may possibly
be due to a mixture with the broad-headed race. In
that case, however, none of the tallness, or prognathism,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
of the latter has been handed down. It is most probably
a mere variation within the limits of one race,
and is unaccompanied by the fusion of dolicho-cephalic
with brachy-cephalic characters, such as M. Broca and
Dr. Thurnam have observed in the skulls from tombs
and caves in France.</p>

<p>From the examples given in the preceding pages it
is evident that, in ancient times, long-headed men
of small stature inhabited the whole of Britain and Ireland,
burying their dead in caves, but more generally in
chambered tombs. They were farmers and shepherds,
and in this country in the neolithic stage of culture.
In the solitary case offered by the Harbour mound at
Keiss they were cannibals.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_80"><i>The Range of the Brachy-cephali.</i></h3>

<p>No human remains of the brachy-cephalic, or broad
type, as defined by Dr. Thurnam have been obtained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
from the caves in Britain. The evidence, however, is
decisive that, in the Bronze age, a tall, round-headed,
rugged-featured race occupied all those parts of Britain
and Ireland that were worth conquering, and drove
away to the west or absorbed the smaller neolithic
inhabitants. And the identity of their skull-form, in
the series of interments in the round and bowl-shaped
barrows, extending from the Bronze age down to the
date of the Roman occupation of Britain, shows that,
both in the North and the South, this large-sized
coarse-featured people was in possession at the time of
the Roman conquest.</p>

<p>The size and shape of the typical broad crania may
be gathered from the first two columns of the following
Table, which is an abstract of those published by Dr.
Thurnam in “Crania Britannica,” and the “Memoirs of
the Anthropological Society.”</p>

<h3 id="hdr_81"><i>The Range of the Dolicho-cephali and Brachy-cephali
in France in the Neolithic Age.&mdash;The Caverne de
l’Homme Mort.</i></h3>

<p>The researches of M. Broca and Dr. Thurnam into
the caves and tombs of France prove that the small
dolicho-cephali and the tall brachy-cephali lived in that
country in the neolithic age. We are indebted to the
former for a most important account of the Caverne de
l’Homme Mort, which reproduces all the essential points
which we have observed in the sepulchral caves of
Denbighshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p id="hdr_82">The Caverne de l’Homme Mort<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> is situated in a lonely
ravine that penetrates the wild limestone plateau, in
the south-west of the department of Lozère, near the
hamlet of Vialle, in the commune of St. Pierre des
Tripiés. It was discovered by the peasants, and its
contents were partially disturbed by their search after
hidden treasure before it was explored by Dr. Prunières.
In front of the cave was a platform, composed of earth
mingled with fragments of charcoal, forming a layer
about forty centimetres thick, in which were the stones
of seven hearths, flint-flakes and scrapers, lance-heads,
broken bones of the hare, fallow-deer, roe, pig (or wild-boar).
All the flints were worked, and one lance-head
had been chipped out of the stump of a celt and presented
portions of the polished surface, thus fixing the
neolithic age of the accumulation. Coarse pottery was
also met with.</p>

<p>The bones of the hare were very abundant, and
proved that there was no prejudice against the use of
its flesh. In the caves of Perthi-Chwareu we have also
seen that this was the case.</p>

<p>The refuse-heaps ceased abruptly at the entrance of
the cave, at a point where the traces of a wall, composed
of large stones, was visible. Immediately behind this
were human bones, in a thick layer of dry sand, scattered
about in the wildest confusion, which was probably
the result of successive interments, as well as of subsequent
disturbance by burrowing animals and treasure-seekers.
Two bone-points and a flint arrow-head were
the only implements discovered within the sepulchral
chamber.</p>

<p>Two small human bones, bearing undoubted marks of
having been burnt, were discovered in the refuse-heap;
but they do not, as M. Broca justly observes, imply the
practice of cannibalism, since they may have fallen out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
of the burial-place, and subsequently have come into
contact with the fire on one of the hearths.</p>

<p>It is impossible to estimate the number of interments
in this cave. Exclusive of the many skulls which have
been destroyed or lost, M. Prunières obtained nineteen
very nearly perfect, which are described by M. Broca
as seven male, six female, three of uncertain sex, and
three children. They are remarkable for the softness
of their contours, the delicacy of their features, and the
orthognathism of their faces. The forehead is wide and
high, and the vertex and the occipital region of the
skull well rounded. The cephalic index varies between
·680 and ·78, the mean of the whole series being ·732.</p>

<p>M. Broca remarks, that these crania contrast strongly
with those of the present broad-headed inhabitants of
the district, and that they differ from those found in
the dolmens by M. Prunières in their greater length,
in the smallness of their features, and the weakness of
their muscular impressions. The study of the bones of
the skeleton confirms these differences. The men who
buried their dead in the Caverne de l’Homme Mort
were smaller than the dolmen builders, their bones were
more slender, and they were altogether a less muscular
race. They are considered by M. Broca to represent the
neolithic aborigines; and if his description and measurements
be compared with those of the dolicho-cephali
of Britain, given by Dr. Thurnam (p.&nbsp;191 <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">et seq.</i>), it will
be seen that they are identical with the latter, which is
the oldest race yet known to have occupied Great Britain
since the close of the pleistocene period.</p>

<p>At a little distance from the sepulchral cave, and in
the same ravine, M. Broca explored a large cavern, which
had been occupied, probably by the same people, since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the same kind of instruments were discovered as in the
refuse-heap. So that we have here, side by side, the
abode and the sepulchre of the same ancient tribe.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_83"><i>The Sepulchral Cave of Orrouy.</i></h3>

<p>The sepulchral cave of Orrouy (Oise) described by M.
Broca, in which the remains of about fifty individuals
were interred, furnished both types of skull, united,
according to Dr. Thurnam and M. Broca,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> by a series of
intermediate forms, that prove a fusion of blood between
the broad- and the long-headed peoples. On referring
to the preceding Table (p.&nbsp;199) it will be seen that the
cephalic index varies from ·75 to ·88. Eight out of the
series of twenty-one skulls united the characteristic
dolicho-cephalous fore-head with the brachy-cephalous
middle and hind-head. “We have here,” writes Dr.
Thurnam, “a veritable hybrid form of cranium, resulting
from the mixture or crossing, under certain circumstances
unknown to us, of a dolicho-cephalous with
a brachy-cephalous race.”</p>

<p>“... In the Orrouy skulls of hybrid form, two
encephalic growth-tendencies appear to me distinguishable;
one, the longitudinal or fronto-occipital; the other
a transverse, or bi-parietal and temporal one. Now the
remarkable supramastoid depressions, visible in the hindhead
of these skulls, seem to be well explained by the
idea of an intersection or crossing of these two tendencies
in the brain-growth; corresponding, as they
must have done, to the angles formed by the posterior
surfaces of the middle, the lower surfaces of the posterior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
and temporal lobes of the cerebrum, and the upper surface
of the cerebellum.”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>In eight out of thirty-four humeri the fossa of the
olecranon is perforated.</p>

<p>The human remains occurred in the same confusion
as at Perthi-Chwareu, and were associated with fragments
of coarse pottery, flint flakes, and bones of ruminants.
The occurrence of polished stone celts indicates
the neolithic age of the interment.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_84"><i>Skulls from French Tumuli.</i></h3>

<p>Both long and broad skulls also occur in the chambered
tombs of France, although the latter by far predominate.
Those from the Long Barrow at Chamant
are dolicho-cephalic and ortho-cephalic, with cephalic
index ranging from ·71 to ·78 (Broca), and other similar
cases are quoted by Dr. Thurnam from Noyelles-sur-Mer,
Fontenay, and other tumuli. In the large sepulchral
chamber at Meudon, that contained 200 skeletons, the
majority of the skulls were brachy-cephalic, although
twenty of them were of the ortho-cephalic type. This
mixture may be accounted for, most probably, by the
two races, which are clearly defined from each other in
Britain, being intermingled in France.</p>

<p>Dr. Thurnam, summing up the whole evidence as
regards the distribution of races in the tombs of Gaul,
concludes that the two races came into contact in Gaul
at an earlier period in the neolithic age than in Britain.
And this must necessarily have been the case from the
geographical position of our island, which could only be
invaded, in those times, by the races in possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
contiguous mainland of France and Belgium. Both
these regions must have been conquered before an invasion
could have taken place.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_85"><i>The Dolicho-cephali of the Iberian Peninsula, Gibraltar.</i></h3>

<p>The researches carried on from 1863 to 1868, by
Captain Brome, aided by Dr. Falconer and Professor
Busk,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> into the caves of Gibraltar, have resulted in the
proof that, in the neolithic age, that barren rock was
inhabited by a race of men identical with that which is
found in the long barrows and caves of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The enlargement of the military prison on the top of
Windmill Hill revealed the existence of a deep fissure,
containing dark earth, mingled with charcoal and broken
bones, which led into a series of chambers. The upper
of these is described by Captain Brome as being completely
choked up to the roof with earth, charcoal, and
decomposed bones of mammals, birds, and fishes, flint
flakes, and pottery. Below were two floors of stalagmite,
filled with loose stones and earth, through which
a shaft penetrated into a fissure at a lower level, leading
into a lower chamber that had a free communication
with the surface, since the current of air was so strong
as to extinguish the lamps. In this also human remains
and works of art were met with. The passages were
very complicated, and in some of them a red breccia
contained the remains of the pleistocene mammals, the
spotted hyæna, the <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros hemitœchus</i>, and others.
This series of passages and chambers is described by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Captain Brome and Professor Busk as “Genista Cave
No. 1.”</p>

<p>A second, or “Genista, No. 2,” was discovered by
Captain Brome opening on the surface near the West
Cliff, with its floor covered with stalagmite, under which
was the same class of remains as that above mentioned.
Subsequently a third and fourth, “Genista, 3 and 4,”
were explored with the same results, of which the latter,
opening on the face of a vertical cliff 40 feet below the
summit, from its difficulty of access must have been
used as a place of refuge rather than of habitation or
burial. With this exception, the whole group of Genista
Caves contained human bones, resting in the greatest
confusion, and proving that since the bodies had been
interred the contents had been disturbed, either by the
burrowing of animals or by the action of water, pools of
which were present in some of the chambers. Evidence
of the former presence of water was to be seen in the
sheets of stalagmite on most of the floors. The same
confusion would result, as is suggested by Professor
Busk, by interments at successive times. The intimate
association of the fractured bones of the animals, and the
charcoal, broken pottery, and other traces of occupation,
with the human bones, may be accounted for in the same
manner as the similar mixture of remains in the caves
of Denbighshire. If the caves had been inhabited at
one time, and subsequently set apart for burials, the
human bones would become intermingled with the
accumulation of refuse on the floors by the causes above
mentioned.</p>

<p>The bones of the animals associated with the human
remains belong, according to Professor Busk, to the
domestic ox of various sizes, goat, ibex, hog, arvicola,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
hare, rabbit, badger, dog, and a species of phocæna, fish,
birds, and marine and land molluscs. The pottery is for
the most part hand-made, coarse and imperfectly burnt;
and the vessels in some cases had singular perforated
spouts, similar to those still in use by the Kabyles of
Algeria, and some of the Berber tribes. Some of it,
however, is of a fine red ware turned in the lathe, and
probably introduced at a later period, even, as remarked
by Mr. Franks, after the Roman occupation of Spain, to
which he refers a bronze fish-hook, the only metallic
article found in the group of caves. The implements of
bone consist of a needle, and rounded pins and spikes.
One cannon-bone of a small ox bears marks of sharp
cuts with an edge of metal, inflicted probably, as
Professor Busk suggests, “in an attempt to hamstring
the animal, as is sometimes done at the present day in
the Spanish bull-ring.” It may possibly be more modern
than the stone implements found in the same cave.</p>

<p>The associated stone articles are celts of polished
greenstone, similar to that found in the neolithic cave
at Perthi-Chwareu (<a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a>), flakes, a greenstone chisel,
querns and rubbing-stones, a whetstone perforated for suspension,
and a fragment of an armlet made of alabaster.
A small lump of coarse plumbago may have been used
for personal ornament.</p>

<p>The human remains examined by Professor Busk
belonged to a large number of individuals of all ages,
and are for the most part in a fragmentary condition.
Some of the thigh-bones are carinate, and remarkable
for the enormous development of the <i class="anatomy">linea aspera</i>
and the thickness of their walls (<a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>), the medullary
cavity being reduced to a small size, as in
those figured from the tumulus at Cefn. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
tibiæ are platycnemic, presenting the peculiar lateral
flattening which first attracted the attention of Dr.
Falconer and Professor Busk (<a href="#Fig_49">Figs. 49, 50, and 51</a>), but
which M. Broca has since determined in the tumuli
and caves of France, and I have discovered in those of
Denbighshire (p.&nbsp;177).</p>

<div id="Fig_62" class="figcenter" style="width: 526px;">
  <img src="images/i_207.jpg" width="526" height="456" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 62, 63, 64.</span>&mdash;Cranium from Genista Cave (Busk).</div></div>

<p>The only two crania sufficiently perfect to allow of a
comparison being made, from Genista Cave No. 3, are
perfectly symmetrical, and belong to a high type
(<a href="#Fig_62">Figs. 62, 63, and 64</a>). “They are dolicho-cephalic, quite
orthognathous, and wholly aphanozygous. In one the
frontal sinuses are considerably more developed than
they are in the other, but in neither is there any thickening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
of the supra-orbital border” (Busk). The teeth are
worn flat. They both belonged to men in the prime of
life. A third skull, from Genista Cave No. 1, belongs
to the same type. The measurements of the two most
perfect skulls are given in the same table as those from
North Wales (p.&nbsp;171).</p>

<p>Gibraltar has also been occupied in ancient times by
broad-headed men, similar, in M. Broca’s opinion, to those
interred in the cave of Orrouy. In 1864 human bones,
together with a skull (for measurements see <a href="#Page_199">p. 199</a>),
were dug out of the Judge’s Cave by Sir James Cochrane.
The tibiæ are platycnemic, and the skull is described
by Professor Busk as being “perfectly symmetrical,
brachy-cephalic, slightly prognathous, but with vertical
teeth, aphanozygous. The forehead is well arched, and
the supra-orbital border slightly elevated, the orbits
being square, and the nasal opening elongated and pyriform.”
The cephalic index is ·792. The age of these
skeletons is uncertain.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_86"><i>Spain.&mdash;Cueva de los Murcièlagos.</i></h3>

<p>Professor Busk<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> calls attention to the fact, that a long
skull similar to that from Gibraltar has been found in
Spain, in an ancient copper-mine of the Asturias, together
with hammers made of antler, and that it bears
“the closest possible resemblance” to the Basque skulls,
described by M. Broca, from Guipuscoa on the Spanish
and St. Jean de Luz on the French side of the Pyrenees.
He points out, also, the resemblance which exists between
the crania figured by Don Gongora y Martinez, from the
caverns and dolmens of Andalusia and those under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
consideration; finally arriving at the conclusion that
“a pretty uniform priscan race at one time pervaded
the peninsula from one end to the other, and that this
race is at the present day represented by, at any rate,
a part of the population now inhabiting the Basque
provinces.”</p>

<p>In the work of Don Manuel Gongora y Martinez<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
referred to, there is a most interesting account of the
prehistoric antiquities of Andalusia. Several interments
are described in the Cueva de los Murcièlagos, a cave
running into the limestone rock, out of which the grand
scenery of the southern part of the Sierra Nevada has
been, to a great extent, carved. In one spot, a group of
three skeletons was met with, one of which was adorned
with a plain coronet of gold, and clad in a tunic made
of esparto-grass, finely plaited, so as to form a pattern
which resembles some of the designs on gold ornaments
from Etruscan tombs. At a spot further within, a
second group of twelve skeletons lay in a semicircle,
around one considered by Don Manuel to have belonged
to a woman, covered with a tunic of skin, and wearing
a necklace of esparto-grass, a marine shell pierced for
suspension, the carved tusk of a wild boar, and earrings
of black stone. There were other articles of plaited
esparto-grass, such as baskets and sandals; flint flakes,
pieces of a white marble armlet, polished axes of the
type of <a href="#Fig_38">fig. 38</a>, bone awls, and a wooden spoon, together
with pottery of the same type as that from Gibraltar,
fragments of charcoal, and bones of animals.</p>

<p>Although, in this cave, there were no traces of metal,
except gold, in a second, in the same neighbourhood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
similar interments were met with in association with
copper (bronze) implements, and with pottery of the
same kind.</p>

<p>These interments in caves are of the same order
as those from Gibraltar; and since the skulls agree
with those from the latter, there can be little doubt
but that, in the neolithic age, the long-headed small
race under discussion had possession of the southern
provinces.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_87"><i>The Woman’s Cave, near Alhama.</i></h3>

<p>This conclusion derives additional support from the
discoveries subsequently made by Mr. McPherson<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
in the Woman’s Cave, near Alhama, in Grenada, of
implements of bone, flint, and greenstone of the neolithic
age, mingled with charcoal, pottery, and human
skeletons of the same type as those from Gibraltar.
The human skull, figured by Mr. McPherson, is dolicho-cephalic,
and the thigh-bone is remarkable for the extreme
development of the <i class="anatomy">linea aspera</i>, which assumes
the form of a stout ridge sweeping from one extremity
of the shaft to the other.</p>

<p>This long-headed race, burying their dead in caves,
also erected dolmens in Andalusia. In the dolmen
of De los Eriales<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> human remains were discovered along
with bronze (copper?) lance-heads, and pottery of the
same sort as that of the caves. It is, therefore, evident
that the practice of burial in caves, and of erecting
dolmens, was carried on by the same people in Britain,
in France, and in Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_88"><i>The Guanches of the Canary Isles.</i></h3>

<p>The Guanches,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> the ancient inhabitants of the Canary
Isles, are considered by Berthollet, Glas, and other high
authorities, to be allied to the Berbers of North Africa in
language. At the time of their discovery and conquest
by the Spaniards, they are described by Miss Haigh as
being unacquainted with the use of any metal, and as
fashioning their weapons out of a black, hard stone.
The Guanches of Teneriffe lived principally in caves, preferring
for their winter residence those near the coast, and
“in the summer those in the higher parts in the interior
of the island, whence they could enjoy the fresh air of
the hills.” Some of these caves have been excavated by
the hand of man, and are divided into square chambers,
containing rock-hewn benches, “and deep niches made
to contain vessels of milk or water.” They had also
stone houses, thatched with straw or fern. They also
buried their dead in sepulchral caves, belonging each to
a family or clan, entrances to which are carefully concealed,
and are now discovered only by accident. In them
the dead were placed either upright, or lying side by side
on wooden scaffolds, after having been prepared with
salt and butter and thoroughly dried and wrapped in
the tanned skins of sheep or goat. In some cases the
prepared body was placed in the sitting posture.</p>

<p>They were possessed of a settled government by
“Menceys,” or chiefs subordinate to one head, and
were divided into “nobles and common people, and
had a code of punishment for the robber, murderer,
and adulterer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Their food consisted of sheep and goats, roasted
barley ground between two stones, and the fruit of the
arbutus, date-palm and fig, as well as fish and rabbits.
Their fences were made of reed, their ropes and nets
of rushes, and their baskets, mats, and bags, of palm-leaves.
They manufactured vessels out of clay or hard
wood, needles of fishbones, beads of clay, and they
especially excelled in the art of tanning. The civilization
of this very interesting people may fairly be
taken to be a fragment of that of North Africa and
of Europe in the neolithic age, protected by insulation
from the influences by which it was swept away from
the countries bordering on the shores of the Mediterranean,
just as the old Norse customs and legends are
preserved by the present inhabitants of Iceland in
greater purity than in Norway.</p>

<p>The Berbers are viewed by Professor Busk as of the
same non-Aryan stock as the Basque, and the civilization
of the Guanches may therefore be taken to represent
that of the Iberic peoples of Spain, among whom
caves were used in like manner for habitation and
burial.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_89"><i>Iberic Dolicho-cephali of the same Race as those of Britain.</i></h3>

<p>If this group of Iberic skulls be compared with those
from the caves and tumuli of Great Britain (see Table,
<a href="#list_197">p. 197</a> and that below) it will be seen, that what Professor
Busk observes of the ancient population of Spain
is equally true of that of our country in the neolithic age.
And the identity of form is especially remarkable in
the crania from the sepulchral caves at Perthi-Chwareu,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
the difference between them being so small as to be of

<h3 id="hdr_90"><i>The Dolicho-cephali cognate with the Basque.</i></h3>

<p>Nor can the truth of Professor Busk’s conclusion, that
the group of skulls in question belong to a people akin
in blood to the modern Basques, be disputed. We are
indebted to M. Broca<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> for the elaborate description of
seventy-eight Basque crania from a village cemetery in
Guipuscoa, and of fifty-eight from an ossuary at St. Jean
de Luz, in which they had been collected in the reign of
Francis I., 1532. In both these groups the long and oval
types predominated, the broad type being represented by
6·4 (Thurnam) per cent. in the one, and 37·36 per cent.
(Broca) in the other; a difference that is doubtless caused
by the greater mixture of blood in the south-west of
France than in the north-west of Spain, shut off from
the broad-headed Gallic tribes by the Pyrenees.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> Six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
skulls, obtained by Professor Virchow from Bilbao, agree
in all particulars with those from Guipuscoa. M. Broca
has further shown, that this group of Spanish skulls
offers all the characters of the black-haired, swarthy,
oval-faced, Basque population of the surrounding region,
and it therefore follows, that they may be taken
as standards of comparison, as typical of the ancient
Basque crania, modified, it may be, to some extent, by
the infusion of other blood. Their agreement, therefore,
with the skulls from Gibraltar implies that the latter are
also Basque. And since they agree also with those from
the cave of Perthi-Chwareu, as may be seen in the preceding
Table, the men who buried their dead in the
caves of North Wales in the neolithic age, are proved
to belong to the same stock.</p>

<p>The same long-headed, small race also inhabited
France, side by side with the broad-headed Gallic
tribes; and since to it belong the skeletons in the
Cave de l’Homme Mort, which M. Broca refers to the
neolithic aborigines, it may reasonably be concluded
that in Gaul, as in Britain, it was the older of the two
races. The two have also been met with in the caves of
Belgium. If we allow that an aboriginal Basque population
spread over the whole of Britain, France, and
Belgium, and that it was subsequently dispossessed by
broad-headed invaders, the two extremes of skull-form
and of stature, and of the gradations between them, may
be satisfactorily explained. And this view coincides
with the well-ascertained facts of history.</p>

<p>Dr. Thurnam was the first to recognize that the long
skulls, out of the long barrows of Britain and Ireland,
were of the Basque or Iberian type, and Professor
Huxley holds that the river-bed skulls belong to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
same race.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> (Compare Table <a href="#list_197">p. 197</a> with the preceding.)
We have therefore proof, that an Iberian or Basque population
spread over the whole of Britain and Ireland in
the neolithic age, inhabiting caves, and burying their
dead in caves and chambered tombs, just as in the
Iberian Peninsula also in the neolithic age.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_91"><i>Dolicho-cephali and Brachy-cephali in Neolithic Caves
of Belgium.&mdash;Chauvaux.</i></h3>

<p>Both these forms of skull have been met with in Belgium,
the one in the famous cave of Chauvaux, the
other in that of Sclaigneaux.</p>

<p>The first of these is a rock-shelter passing into a small
cave, at the base of the limestone cliff on the Meuse,
opposite the little village of Rivière, between Dinant
and Namur. It was known to contain human remains
in 1837&ndash;8, and was partially explored in 1842
by Dr. Spring, who published his account of the discoveries
in 1853, and subsequently in 1864 and 1866.
Below a thin layer of loam was a floor of stalagmite,
concealing a vast number of broken human bones mixed
pêle-mêle with those of wild and domestic animals,
and associated with charcoal and coarse pottery. Two
polished stone celts indicated the neolithic age of the
accumulation; one of them resting close to a skull
which had been fractured by a blow from a blunt
instrument, such as it may have inflicted. The human
bones belonged to infants and young adults.</p>

<p>From the fractured and burnt bones of the animals it
is clear that they had been accumulated in the cave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
daring the time that it was inhabited by man. Dr.
Spring<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> inferred that the broken human bones proved
that human beings, as well as the animals, formed the
food of the cave-dwellers, and further, since all the human
remains belong to young individuals, that the cannibalism
was not accidental, or caused by famine, but the
result of a deliberate selection.</p>

<p>The facts which induced Dr. Spring to come to this
conclusion are interpreted by M. Dupont<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> in a different
manner. He holds, that the proportion of young
individuals is not greater in Chauvaux than that which
he has observed in other sepulchral caves in Belgium,
and that there is nothing which forbids the supposition
that this also was used as a place of interment. The
human bones may have been broken by the foxes and
badgers, which are so abundant in the district, and
have been mixed, by their continual burrowing, with
the remains of the animals in the old refuse-heap
accumulated on the floor during the habitation of man.
Such a mixture of remains we have already observed in
the caves of North Wales and Gibraltar. The recent
researches of M. Soreil<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> leave no room for doubting
the truth of M. Dupont’s interpretation. Two perfect
human skeletons were discovered along with flint
flakes, pottery, a barbed arrow-head, and many scattered
human bones not broken by design, while the long
bones of the associated animals bore unmistakeable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
traces of having been split for the sake of the marrow.
On one long bone, for example, of the ox, there were
cuts made by a flint implement, as well as the mark of
the blow by which it had been split longitudinally; and
another ox-bone, and the canine of a boar, bore marks of
burning. The bones of the animals were very abundant,
and belonged to the following species: beaver, hamster,
and other small rodents, hare, badger, fox, boar, stag,
roe, ox, and goat. In this case, as in the caves of
Perthi-Chwareu, and of l’Homme Mort, the inhabitants
had used the hare for food, as well as the other
animals, and did not share the prejudice against the
use of its flesh for food, which Cæsar remarks of the
inhabitants of Britain (Comm. 1, xii.).</p>

<p>The cave must, therefore, be viewed as a place of
sepulture for a neolithic people, whose implements
abound in the neighbourhood, and not as having been
inhabited by a race of cannibals.</p>

<p>The bodies had been interred in the crouching posture,
with their thighs bent, their heads resting on their arms,
and their faces turned towards the valley. They rested
side by side in two small holes, which had been dug in
the deposit containing the bones of the animals, and the
skeletons were cemented to the rock by stalagmite, and
surrounded by large stones. They belonged to individuals
far past the prime of life.</p>

<p>Both skulls were dolicho-cephalic, and the most
perfect of them is described by Professor Virchow as
presenting a parietal flattening, which is probably
analogous to the “tête annulaire,” so commonly
present in the long skulls of the neolithic age. It
possesses a cephalic index of ·72 (·718 Virchow). The
sutures in both the skulls were very nearly obliterated.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
The measurements are given in the Table in
page 199.</p>

<p>The crania, in all these characters, are to be classified
with the long skulls from the caves and chambered
tombs of France, Britain, and Spain. They belong to
people in the same stage of culture, and practising the
same mode of burial in a crouching posture. Chauvaux
is the furthest cave to the east on the continent of
Europe, in which traces of this long-headed race have
been observed.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_92"><i>The Cave of Sclaigneaux.</i></h3>

<p>The cave of Sclaigneaux,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> explored by M. Arnould,
near the hamlet of that name, fourteen miles from
Namur, has been proved to contain human bones,
lying mixed with those of the animals in the refuse-heap
on the floor, as in the cave of Chauvaux. The
animals belonged to existing <span class="locked">species:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0 in4">

</p>

<p>Bones of birds, frogs, and fishes were also met with.
Intermingled with these were human skeletons, disposed
in a rude sort of order, and belonging to bodies which
had been interred at different times. From the lower
jaws M. Arnould calculates that the number of bodies
interred was not less than sixty-two, of which twelve
belonged to aged individuals, twenty-one to those in the
prime of life, sixteen to young adults, and thirteen
to children.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 65, 66.</span>&mdash;Skull from Cave of Sclaigneaux. (Arnould.)</div></div>

<p>The crania (<a href="#Fig_65">Figs. 65, 66</a>) are brachy-cephalic (see
Table, <a href="#list_199">p. 199</a>), and are possessed, according to M.
Arnould, of the following characters. The apex of the
cranial vault is flattened, probably artificially, and the
parietal bosses are largely developed, to which is due
the great width of the skull. The surciliary ridges are
strongly marked, and the malar bones are prominent.
In all these particulars they agree with
the broad skulls, as defined by Dr. Thurnam,
discovered in the round tumuli
of Britain and the sepulchral caves of
France.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>&mdash;Platycnemic tibia, from Sclaigneaux.</div></div>

<p>Some of the leg-bones presented the
antero-posterior flattening, or platycnemism,
observed in the skeletons from
the caves of Gibraltar, and in France
and Great Britain (<a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a>). It is due,
as in those from North Wales, to the
anterior expansion of the bone, and not to the posterior,
as is the case with those from the cave of Cro-Magnon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
A beautifully chipped arrow-head, with barbs and
central tongue for insertion into the shaft, of the same
type as one from Chauvaux, implies that these remains
belong to the neolithic age. Implements of bone, and
a shell perforated for suspension, were also found.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_93"><i>The Evidence of History as to the Peoples of Gaul and Spain.</i></h3>

<p>The extension of this non-Aryan race through France,
Spain, and Britain, in ancient times, based solely on the
evidence of the human remains, is confirmed by an
appeal to the ethnology of Europe within the historic
period. In the Iberian peninsula the Basque populations
of the west are defined from the Celtic of the east by the
Celtiberi inhabiting the modern Castille (see Map, <a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>). In Gaul the province of Aquitania extended as
far north, in Cæsar’s time,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> as the river Garonne, constituting
the modern Gascony, to which was added, in
the days of Augustus, the district between that river
and the Loire; a change of frontier that was probably
due to the predominance of Basque blood in a mixed
race in that area similar to the Celtiberi of Castille.
The Aquitani were surrounded on every side, except the
south, by the Celtæ, extending as far north as the Seine,
as far to the east as Switzerland and the plains of Lombardy,
and southwards, through the valley of the Rhone
and the region of the Volcæ, over the Eastern Pyrenees
into Spain. The district round the Phocæan colony of
Marseilles was inhabited by Ligurian tribes, who held
the region between the river Po and the Gulf of Genoa,
as far as the western boundary of Etruria, and who probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
extended to the west along the coast of Southern
Gaul as far as the Pyrenees.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> They were distinguished
from the Celtæ, not merely by their manners and customs,
but by their small stature and dark hair and eyes,
and are stated by Pliny and Strabo to have inhabited
Spain. They have also left marks of their presence in
Central Gaul in the name of the Loire (Ligur), and possibly
in Britain in the obscure name of the Lloegrians.
They invaded Sicily<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> as the Sikelians, and <em>if</em> the latter
be identified with the Sikanians considered by Thucydides<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>
and other writers to be of Iberian stock, it will
follow that they are a cognate race. Their stature and
swarthy complexion, as well as the ancient geographical
position conterminous with the Iberic population of Gaul
and Spain, confirm this conclusion. The non-Aryan and
probably Basque population of Gaul was therefore cut
into two portions by a broad band of Celts, which crosses
the Eastern Pyrenees, and marks the route by which the
Iberian peninsula was invaded.</p>

<div id="Fig_68" class="figcenter" style="width: 535px;">
  <img src="images/i_221.jpg" width="535" height="930" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>&mdash;Distribution of Basque, Celtic, and Belgic Peoples, at dawn of History.</div></div>

<p>The ancient population of Sardinia is stated by Pausanias
to be of Libyan extraction, and to bear a strong
resemblance to the Iberians in physique and in habits
of life, while that of Corsica is described by Seneca as
Ligurian and Iberian. The ancient Libyans are represented
at the present day by the Berber and Kabyle
tribes which are, if not identical with, at all events
cognate with the Basques. We may therefore infer that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
these two islands were formerly occupied by this non-Aryan
race, as well as the adjacent continents of Northern
Africa and Southern Europe.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_94"><i>The Basque Population the Oldest.</i></h3>

<p>The relative antiquity of these two races in Europe
may be arrived at by this distribution. The Basques,
Sikani or Ligurian, are the oldest inhabitants, in their
respective districts, known to the historian; while the
Celts appear as invaders, pressing southwards and westwards
on the populations already in possession, flooding
over the Alps and under Brennus sacking Rome, and
by their union with the vanquished in Spain constituting
the Celtiberi. We may therefore be tolerably certain
that the Basques held France and Spain before the invasion
of the Celts, and that the non-Aryan peoples
were cut asunder, and certain parts of them left&mdash;Ligurians,
Sikani, and in part Sardinians and Corsicans&mdash;as
ethnological islands, marking, so to speak, an ancient
Basque non-Aryan continent which had been submerged
by the Celtic populations advancing steadily
westwards.</p>

<p>At the time of the Roman conquest of Gaul, the
Belgæ were pressing on the Celts, just as the latter
pressed the Basques, the Seine and the Marne forming
their southern boundary, and in their turn being pushed
to the west by the advance of the Germans in the Rhine
provinces. Thus we have the oldest population, or
Basque, invaded by the Celts, the Celts by the Belgæ,
and these again by the Germans; their relative positions
stamping their relative antiquity in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_95"><i>The Population of Britain.</i></h3>

<p>The Celtic and Belgic invasion of Gaul repeated itself,
as might be expected, in Britain. Just as the Celts
pushed back the Iberian population of Gaul as far south
as Aquitania, and swept round it into Spain, so they
crossed over the Channel and overran the greater portion
of Britain, until the Silures, identified by Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> with
the Iberians, were left only in those fastnesses that
formed subsequently a bulwark for the Brit-Welsh against
the English invaders. And just as the Belgæ pressed
on the rear of the Celts as far as the Seine, so they
followed them into Britain, and took possession of the
“Pars Maritima,”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> or southern counties. The unsettled
condition of the country at the time of Cæsar’s invasion
was, probably, due to the struggle then going
on between Celts and Belgæ.</p>

<p>The evidence offered by history as to the distribution
of these races confirms that which has been arrived
at by the examination of the caves and tumuli. In
the one case the Basque peoples are merely known
in a fragmentary condition in Britain, Gaul, and Sicily,
while in the other those fragments are joined together
in such a way as to show that, in the neolithic
age, they extended uninterrupedly through Western
Europe, from the Pillars of Hercules in the south to
Scotland in the north, before they were dispossessed by
their broad-headed enemies. It is impossible to define
with precision their ethnological relation to the non-Aryan
inhabitants of Italy and the coasts of the Mediterranean,
such as the Etruscans and Tyrrhenians. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
am, however, inclined to hold that they are all branches
of the same race of “Melanochroi,” differing far less
from each other than the Celtic from the Scandinavian
branch of the Aryan family.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_96"><i>Basque Element in present British and French Populations.</i></h3>

<p>This non-Aryan blood is still to be traced in the
dark-haired, black-eyed, small, oval-featured peoples in
our own country in the region of the Silures, where the
hills have afforded shelter to the Basque populations
from the invaders.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> The small swarthy Welshman of
Denbighshire is in every respect, except dress and
language, identical with the Basque inhabitant of the
Western Pyrenees, at Bagnères de Bigorre.</p>

<p>The small dark-haired people of Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> and especially
those to the west of the Shannon, according to
Dr. Thurnam and Professor Huxley, are also of Iberian
derivation, and singularly enough there is a legendary
connection between that island and Spain. The human
remains from the chambered tombs as well as the riverbeds
prove that the non-Aryan population spread over the
whole of Ireland as well as the whole of Britain. The
main mass of the Irish population is undoubtedly Celtic,
crossed with Danish, Norse, and English blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
The Basque element in the population of France
is at the present time centered in the old province of
Aquitaine, in which the jet-black hair and eyes, and
swarthy complexion, strike the eye of the traveller, now
as in the days of Strabo,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> and form a vivid contrast
with the brown hair and grey eyes of the inhabitants of
Celtica and Belgica (see Map, <a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>). If <a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>
be compared with the map published by Dr. Broca
(“Mémoires d’Anthropologie,” t. i. p. 330), which shows
at a glance the average complexion prevailing in each
department, and the relative number of exemptions per
1,000 conscripts, on account of their not coming up to
the standard of height (1·56 metre = 5 feet 1½ inches),
it will be seen that the only swarthy people outside
the boundary of Aquitaine constitute five ethnological
islands. Of these Brittany is by far the largest, probably
because its fastnesses afforded a shelter to the Basques,
who were being driven to the south-west. The department
of the Meuse, in the north, and those of Tarn
and Arriège, in the south, are also sundered from
the main body, while those of the Upper and Lower
Alps present us with the descendants of the ancient
Ligurian tribes.</p>

<p>The people with dark-brown hair, considered by Dr.
Broca to be the result of the intermingling of a dark
with a fair race, are scattered about through Aquitaine,
and occur only in two departments in northern Celtica.
The fair people, on the other hand, are massed in northern
Celtica and Belgica. The relation of complexion to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
stature may be gathered from the following table of
exemptions per 1,000 for each <span class="locked">department:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0">From this table it is evident that the swarthy people are
the smallest and the fair the tallest, the intermediate
shades being the result of fusion between the two
extremes.</p>

<p>The distribution therefore of the small swarthy Basque,
and tall fair Celtic and Belgic races in France at the
present time, corresponds essentially with that which we
might have expected from the evidence both of history
and of the neolithic caves and tombs.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>When we consider the many invasions of France, and
the oscillations to and fro of peoples, the persistence of
the Basque population is very remarkable. It is not a
little strange that the type should be so slightly altered
by intermarriage with the conquering races.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_97"><i>Whence came the Basques?</i></h3>

<p>From what region did the Basques invade Europe?
M. Broca, from their identity with the Kabyles and
Berbers, holds that they entered Europe from northern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Africa, spreading over Spain, and passing over the
Pyrenees into southern France. It seems, however, to
me, from their range as far north as Scotland,
and at least as far to the east as Belgium, that they
travelled by the same route that the Celtic, Belgic, and
Germanic tribes travelled long ages afterwards, coming
from the east and pushing their way to the west: and
that while one section chose this route, another
mastered northern Africa, following the same westward
direction as the Saracens. On this hypothesis this great
pre-Aryan migration would start from the central
plateau of Asia, from which all the successive invaders
of Europe have swarmed off.</p>

<p>This view of the eastern derivation of the Basque
peoples is confirmed by the examination of the breeds
of domestic animals which they possessed. The <i class="taxonomy">Bos
longifrons</i>, the sheep, and the goat are derived from
wild stocks that are now to be found only in central
Asia; and the dog and breed of swine with small canines
were also probably imported after they had become the
servants of man in the east.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_98"><i>The Celtic and Belgic Brachy-cephali.</i></h3>

<p>The occurrence of broad-skulls in the tumuli in this
country, and in caves and tumuli in France, proves that
the Basque peoples were invaded during the neolithic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
age. And since Dr. Thurnam has shown that they
are identical in form with Celtic and Belgic skulls,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> it
follows that one or the other of these, probably the Celtic
or the older, was in possession of portions of Britain,
Ireland, and Gaul at that remote time. It is of course
conceivable that non-Celtic races, physically allied to
the Celts or Belgæ, are represented by the human remains
in question; but in that case they have left no
mark behind by which they can be identified. And the
supposition is rendered improbable to the last degree by
the fact, that the older or conquered race&mdash;the Basque&mdash;still
survives, in the area under consideration, the invasions
and vicissitudes which it has undergone. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">A fortiori</i>,
would their conquerors have had a still greater
chance of survival, in the fastnesses which are offered
by these countries. It is therefore reasonable to presume
that the broad-headed peoples in the neolithic caves and
tombs are represented by the Celts, and possibly, though
not probably, in part by the Belgæ, rather than by
the equally broad-headed Wends, Sclavonians, and Fins,
which are not known by the historian to have settled
in Gaul or in Britain. The successive invasions
of Europe have been invariably from the east to the
west, so far as we have any certain knowledge; and it is
most improbable that Wends, Fins, or Sclaves should
have occupied these countries and subsequently have
retreated eastwards against the current of the Celtic,
Belgic, and Germanic invasions.</p>

<p>The Celtæ may, therefore, be inferred to have occupied
Gaul and Britain in the ages of polished stone, bronze,
and of iron, their encroachment on the non-Aryan peoples
being regulated by their strength, and the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
pressure on their rear. The Belgæ probably were not
known in Gaul until the later portion of the iron age,
and were of small importance as compared with the
Celts, whose arms were felt alike in Greece, Italy, Spain,
and Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The Celts were a tall, fair-haired, blue-eyed race
(Xanthochroi), contrasting strongly with the Basque
“Melanochroi”, and in those particulars agreeing with
the Germans.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_99"><i>The Ancient German Race.</i></h3>

<p>The Germans, in the days of Cæsar, were advancing
on the Belgæ in the Rhine provinces, and on the
Helvetii in Switzerland, and are recognized by Tacitus,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>
in Britain as the red-haired, tall inhabitants of Caledonia.
Subsequently they spread over the west and south of
Europe, as Goths, Franks, Scandinavians, English and
Normans; in this country sweeping the Brit-Welsh into
the hilly fastnesses of Wales, making settlements on
many points of the coasts of Ireland, and leaving behind
them, to this day, a considerable infusion of German
blood in the Celtic and Basque populations. They were,
unlike the present inhabitants of North Prussia and
southern and middle Germany, a dolicho-cephalic people,
their length of head being due, according to Gratiolet,
to a frontal instead of an occipital development, which
causes the long-headedness of the Basques. The Anglo-Saxon
skull is defined by Dr. Thurnam as prognathous,
with large facial bones, and with a cephalic index<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
averaging ·75. And these characters are equally to
be found in the Gothic, Frankish, and Scandinavian
crania.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_100"><i>General Conclusions.</i></h3>

<p>In this outline of the ethnology of Gaul and Britain,
it will be seen that two out of the three ethnical elements
(if the Belgic be classed with the Celtic), of which the
present population is composed, can be recognized in the
neolithic users of caves and builders of chambered tombs.
A non-Aryan race either identical or cognate with the
Basque is the earliest traceable in these areas in the
neolithic age, and it probably arrived in Europe by the
same route as the Celtic and Germanic, passing westwards
from the plains of central Asia.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of Spain having been peopled
from northern Africa, the identity of the Berber and
Kabyle with the Basque being due to their being
descended from the same non-Aryan stock in possession
of southern and western Europe, and northern Africa.
They are to be looked upon as cousins rather than
as connected by descent in a right line.</p>

<p>The Basque race was probably in possession of Europe
for a long series of ages, before hordes either identical
or cognate with the Celts gradually crept westward over
Germany into Gaul, Spain, and Britain, driving away,
or absorbing, the inhabitants of the regions which they
conquered.</p>

<p class="in0">There are many prehistoric caves in Britain and on the
Continent which do not contain remains sufficiently
characteristic to fix the date of their use, either for
occupation or burial, unless the term neolithic be understood
to cover the wide interval between the palæolithic
stage of the pleistocene on the one hand, and the bronze
age on the other.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_101"><i>The Paviland Cave.</i></h3>

<p>The Cave of Goat’s Hole<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> at Paviland, in Glamorganshire,
explored by Dr. Buckland in 1823, offers an instance
of an interment having been made in a pre-existent
deposit of the pleistocene age. It consists of a chamber
facing to the sea, in a cliff of limestone 100 feet high,
at a level of from 30 to 40 feet above the high-water
mark. Its floor was composed of red loam, containing
the remains of the woolly-rhinoceros, hyæna, cave-bear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
and mammoth. Close to a skull with tusks of the
last animal a human skeleton (equalling in size the
largest male skeleton in the Oxford Museum) was discovered;
and in the soil, “which had apparently been
disturbed by ancient diggings,” were fragments of charcoal,
a small chipped flint, and the sea-shells of the
neighbouring shore. Certain small ivory ornaments,
found close to the skeleton, are considered by Dr.
Buckland to have been carved out of the tusks of the
mammoth near which they rested; and he justly
remarks that, “as they must have been cut to their
present shape at a time when the ivory was hard, and
not crumbling to pieces, as it is at present at the
slightest touch, we may from this circumstance assume
for them a high antiquity.”</p>

<p>May we not also infer, from the fact of the manufactured
ivory and the tusks from which it was cut being
in precisely the same state of decomposition, that the
tusks were preserved from decay, during the pleistocene
times, by precisely the same agency as those now found
perfect in the polar regions&mdash;namely, the intense cold;
that after the skull of the mammoth had been buried
in the cave, the tusks, thus preserved, were used for the
manufacture of ornaments; and that, at some time subsequent
to the interment of the ornaments with the corpse,
a climatal change has taken place, by which the temperature
in England, France, and Germany has been
raised, and the ivory became decomposed that up to
that time had preserved its gelatine? On this point it is
worthy of remark that fossil tusks have been discovered
in Scotland sufficiently perfect to be used as ivory.
The ornaments may, however, not have been made from
the fossil tusks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
The presence of the bones of sheep underneath the
remains of mammoth, bear, and other animals, coupled
with the state of the cave earth, which had been disturbed
before Dr. Buckland’s examination of the cave,
would prove that the interment is not of pleistocene date.
No traces of sheep or goat have as yet been afforded by
any pleistocene deposit in Britain, France, or Germany.</p>

<p>Dr. Buckland’s conclusion, that the interment is relatively
more modern than the accumulation with remains
of the extinct mammalia, must be accepted as the true
interpretation of the facts. The intimate association
of the two sets of remains, of widely diverse ages, in
this cave show that extreme care is necessary in cave
exploration.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_102"><i>The Cave of Engis.</i></h3>

<p>Human remains have been obtained from some of the
caves of Belgium under circumstances which are generally
considered to indicate that they are of the same antiquity
as the skeletons of the animals with which they are associated.
The possibility, however, of the contents of caves
of different ages being mixed by the action of water, or
by the burrowing of animals, or by subsequent interments,
renders such an association of little value, unless
the evidence be very decided. The famous human skull
discovered by Dr. Schmerling<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> in the cave of Engis,
near Liége, in 1833, is a case in point. It was obtained
from a mass of breccia, along with bones and teeth of
mammoth, rhinoceros, horse, hyæna, and bear; and subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
M. Dupont<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> found in the same spot a human
ulna, other human bones, worked flints, and a small
fragment of coarse earthenware. The discovery of this
last is an argument in favour of the human remains being
of a later date than the extinct mammalia, since pottery
has not yet been proved to have been known to the
palæolithic races who co-existed with them, while it is
very abundant in neolithic burial-places and tombs.
The fact of all the objects being cemented together by
calcareous infiltration is no test of relative age, which
cannot be ascertained without distinct stratification,
such as that in the caves of Wookey and Kent’s Hole.</p>

<p>It seems therefore to me, that the conditions of the
discovery are too doubtful to admit of the conclusion of
Sir Charles Lyell and other eminent writers, that the
human remains are of palæolithic age.</p>

<p>The skull is described by Professor Huxley<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> as being
of average size, its contour agreeing equally well with
some Australian and European skulls; it presents no
marks of degradation, “and is in fact a fair average
human skull, which might have belonged to a philosopher,
or might have contained the thoughtless brains of
a savage.” Its measurements fall within the limits of
the long-skulls described in the preceding chapter, and
it certainly belongs to the same class.</p>

and form of the skulls mentioned in this chapter:</p>

<h3 id="hdr_103"><i>Trou du Frontal.</i></h3>

<p>The human skeletons in the Trou du Frontal, situated
in a picturesque limestone cliff on the banks of the
Lesse, near Furfooz, are considered by M. Dupont to
be of the same age as the contents of the caves close
by the Trou des Nutons and Trou Rosette, which have
been inhabited by palæolithic savages. The following
is the section (<a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>) which he gives of the deposits.
Close to the river Lesse is the alluvium (No. 1), below
which is a clay (No. 2), with angular blocks passing
upwards under the rock shelter, and filling the cave.
Under this is a stratum of loam (No. 3), resting on
gravel (No. 4). Sixteen human skeletons were discovered
in the sepulchral cavity (<span class="smcap smaller">S</span>), at the mouth of
which was a large slab of rock (<span class="smcap smaller">D</span>), by which it was
originally blocked up. A singular urn, with a round
bottom and with the handles perforated for suspension,
was found at the entrance, together with flint flakes,
ornaments in fluorine, and eocene shells perforated for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
suspension. Outside, at the points <span class="smcap smaller">H H</span>, was an accumulation
of broken bones, belonging to the lemming,
tailless hare (Lagomys), beaver, wild cat, boar, horse,
stag, urus, chamois, goat, and other animals, birds and
fishes. From the occurrence of fragments belonging to
two reindeer, it is considered by M. Dupont to belong
to the reindeer age. The old hearth was close by, at
<span class="smcap smaller">F</span> (<a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>).</p>

<div id="Fig_69" class="figcenter" style="width: 533px;">
  <img src="images/i_237.jpg" width="533" height="331" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>&mdash;Section of the Trou du Frontal. (Dupont.)</div></div>

<p>From this section we may infer, that the rock-shelter
was used by man at the points <span class="smcap smaller">H H</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">F</span> before the
formation of the stratum No. 2, which is probably
merely subaerial rain-wash, due to the disintegration of
the adjacent rocks, and that the sepulchral cavity was
a place of burial either before, or while No. 2 was
accumulated. Can we further conclude that there is any
necessary connection between the refuse-heap and the
sepulchre in point of time? M. Dupont holds that the
contents of all the caves in the cliff are palæolithic, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
that the sepulchral cavity is therefore of that age.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> It
seems to me, however, that the evidence in favour of
this view is not conclusive. The burial place may have
belonged to one people, and the refuse-heaps in the
neighbouring caves and <em>outside</em> the slab in the rock-shelter
of the Trou du Frontal to another. The form of
the urn is remarkably like some of those which have
been obtained from the neolithic pile-dwellings of
Switzerland, and therefore may possibly imply that
the interment is of that age.</p>

<p>The human remains were mixed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pêle mêle</i> with stones
and yellow clay within the chamber. Two skulls, sufficiently
perfect to allow of measurement, show that their
possessors were broad-headed (brachy-cephalic), and of
the same type as those of Sclaigneaux. They are considered
by the late Dr. Pruner-Bey to belong to the
“type Mongoloide,” and are believed by M. Dupont
to prove that the palæolithic inhabitants of Belgium
were a Mongoloid race. They seem, however, to be
of the same general order as the broad-skulls from the
neolithic caves and tombs of France, and from the round
barrows of Great Britain, as well as those from the
neolithic tombs of Borreby and Moën in Scandinavia.
And they are looked upon by MM. de Quatrefages,
Virchow, and Lagneaux,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> as presenting the same type
as that which is to be recognized in the present population
of Belgium, in the neighbourhood, for example, of
Antwerp.</p>

<p>These affinities may be explained by the view advanced
by Dr. Thurnam, that the broad-heads of the
British, French, and Scandinavian tombs are cognate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
with the modern Fin; or by the higher generalisation
of Prof. Huxley, that the Swiss “Dissentis” skull, the
South German, the Sclavonian, and the Finnish, belong
to one great race of fair-haired, broad-headed, Xanthochroi
“who have extended across Europe from Britain
to Sarmatia, and we know not how much further to the
east and south.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>Besides these broad crania, M. Lagneaux<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> calls attention
to a fragment, sufficiently perfect to indicate a skull
of the long type (très dolicho-céphale), and that differed
from them in many other particulars. In the Trou du
Frontal, therefore, there is proof that a long and a short-headed
race lived in Belgium side by side, just as a
similar association in the cave of Orrouy establishes the
same conclusion as to the neolithic dwellers in France.
And since skulls of both these types have been discovered
in the neolithic caves of Sclaigneaux and Chauvaux,
the interment in the Trou du Frontal may probably
be referred to that date.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_104"><i>The Cave of Gendron.</i></h3>

<p>The sepulchral cave of Gendron<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> on the Lesse, in
which fourteen skeletons were discovered lying at full
length, and in regular order, along with one flake and
some fragments of pottery, is of uncertain age, since
those articles were found at the entrance, and have no
necessary connection with the interments. And if they
were deposited at the same time, M. Dupont’s view that
they stamp the neolithic age is rendered untenable by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
the fact that flakes and rude pottery were in use as late
as the date of the Roman conquest of Britain, and are
frequently met with in association with articles of
bronze and of iron. And for the same reasons the
neolithic age of the human bones in the Trou de Sureau
and of the Trou de Pont-à-Lesse is open to considerable
doubt. The contents, however, prove these caves to be
post-pleistocene.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_105"><i>Cave of Gailenreuth.</i></h3>

<p>The same uncertainty overhangs the age of the interments
in the cave of Gailenreuth, in Franconia, from
which Dr. Buckland<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> obtained a human skull of the
same broad type as that from Sclaigneaux, along with
fragments of black coarse pottery, one of which is ornamented
with a line of finger-impressions. The skull is
remarkable for the great width of the parietal protuberances,
and the flattening of the upper and posterior
region of the parietal bone. Its measurements are given
in the Table, <a href="#list_236">p. 236</a>, from which it will be seen that it
belongs to the same class of skulls as those from the
neolithic caves and tumuli of France.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_106"><i>Cave of Neanderthal.</i></h3>

<p>The extraordinary skull found in 1857 in the cave of
Neanderthal,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> by Dr. Fuhlrott, with some of the other
bones of the skeleton, was not associated with any other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
animals from which its age could be inferred. “Under
whatever aspect,” writes Professor Huxley, “we view this
cranium, whether we regard its vertical depression, the
enormous thickness of its supraciliary ridges, its sloping
occiput, or its long and straight squamosal suture, we
meet with ape-like characters, stamping it as the most
pithecoid of human crania yet discovered. But Prof.
Schaaffhausen states that the cranium, in its present
condition, holds 1033·24 cubic centimetres of water, or
about 63 cubic inches, and as the entire skull could
hardly have held less than an additional 12 cubic inches,
its capacity may be estimated at about 75 cubic inches,
which is the average capacity given by Morton for
Polynesian and Hottentot skulls.</p>

<p>So large a mass of brain as this would alone suggest
that the pithecoid tendencies, indicated by this skull,
did not extend deep into the organization, and this
conclusion is borne out by the dimensions of the other
bones of the skeleton, given by Prof. Schaaffhausen,
which show that the absolute height and relative proportions
of the limbs were quite those of a European
of middle stature. The bones are indeed stouter, but
this, and the great development of the muscular ridges
noted by Dr. Schaaffhausen, are characters to be expected
in savages. The Patagonians, exposed without shelter or
protection to a climate possibly not very dissimilar from
that of Europe at the time during which the Neanderthal
man lived, are remarkable for the stoutness of their
limb-bones.</p>

<p>In no sense, then, can the Neanderthal bones be regarded
as the remains of a human being intermediate
between men and apes; at most they demonstrate the
existence of a man whose skull may be said to revert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
somewhat towards the pithecoid type&mdash;just as a carrier,
or a poulter, or a tumbler may sometimes put on the
plumage of its primitive stock, the <i class="taxonomy">Columba livia</i>.”</p>

<p>This skull, like the preceding, belongs to the dolicho-cephalic
division, reaching the enormous length of
twelve inches, with a parietal breadth of 5·75.</p>

<p>A long-skull found near Ledbury Hill in Derbyshire,
and belonging to the river-bed type of Prof. Huxley,
comes so close to this one of Neanderthal, that were it
flattened a little and elongated, and possessed of larger
supraciliary ridges, it would be converted into the nearest
likeness which has yet been discovered.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_107"><i>The Caves of France.&mdash;Aurignac.</i></h3>

<p>In the cave of Neanderthal, the question of the antiquity
of the human remains is not complicated by the
juxtaposition of extinct pleistocene animals or of palæolithic
implements. Those caves, however, in France
which claim especial attention, Aurignac, Bruniquel, and
Cro-Magnon, are equally famous for their interments,
and the palæolithic implements which they have furnished,
along with the remains of the mammoth, woolly
rhinoceros, and other extinct animals.</p>

<p>They have both been inhabited by palæolithic man,
and been used some time for burial. Does the period of
habitation coincide with that of the burial? This important
question has been answered almost universally in the
affirmative, and the interments are viewed as evidence
of a belief in the supra-natural among the most ancient
inhabitants of Europe, as well as offering examples of
their physique.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
The famous cave of Aurignac, near the town of
that name, in the department of the Haute Garonne,
was explored and described by the late M. Ed. Lartet,
and his conclusions were adopted by Sir Charles
Lyell in the first three editions of the “Antiquity
of Man.” In the fourth edition,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> however, the latter
author, after a reconsideration of all the circumstances,
qualifies his acceptance of the palæolithic age of the
interments, and shares the doubts which have been expressed
by Sir John Lubbock and Mr. John Evans.
The evidence is as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>M. Lartet’s account falls naturally into two parts:
first, the story which he was told by the original discoverer
of the cave; and, secondly, that in which the
results of his own discoveries are described. We will
begin with the first. In the year 1852, a labourer,
named Bonnemaison, employed in mending the roads,
put his hand into a rabbit-hole (<a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>, <i>f</i>), and drew
out a human bone, and having his curiosity excited,
he dug down until, as his story goes, he came to a
great slab of rock. Having removed this, he discovered
on the other side a cavity seven or eight feet in height,
ten in width, and seven in depth, almost full of human
bones, which Dr. Amiel, the Mayor of Aurignac, who
was a surgeon, believed to represent at least seventeen
individuals. All these human remains were collected,
and finally committed to the parish cemetery, where
they rest to the present day, undisturbed by sacrilegious
hands. Fortunately, however, Bonnemaison in digging
his way into the grotto, had met with the remains
of extinct animals, and works of art; and these were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
preserved until, in 1860, M. Lartet accidentally heard
of the discovery, and investigated the circumstances on
the spot. He found that Bonnemaison, and the sexton
who had buried the human remains, had taken so little
note of the place where they were interred, that it could
not be identified, and on examining the cave he found
that the interior had been ransacked, and the original
stratification to a great extent disturbed. M. Lartet’s
exploration showed that a stratum containing the remains
of the cave-bear, lion, rhinoceros, hyæna, mammoth,
bison, horse, and other animals, and palæolithic
implements, like those of Périgord, extended from the
plateau (<i>d</i>) outside into (<i>b</i>) the cave. On the outside he
met with ashes, and burnt and split bones, which proved
that it had been used as a feasting-place by the palæolithic
hunters; within he detected no traces of charcoal, and
no traces of the hyænas, which were abundant outside.
Inside he met with a few human bones in the earth
which Bonnemaison had disturbed, which were in the
same mineral condition as those of the extinct animals,
and he, therefore, inferred that they were of the same
age. Such is the summary of the facts which M. Lartet
discovered. He has, of his own personal knowledge,
only proved that Aurignac was occupied by a tribe
of hunters during the palæolithic age, and that it had
been used as a burial-place.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>&mdash;Diagram of the Cave of Aurignac.</div></div>

<p>Is he further justified in concluding that the period of
palæolithic occupation coincides with that in which the
burial took place? Bonnemaison’s recollections may be
estimated at their proper value by the significant fact,
that, in the short space of eight years intervening
between the discovery and the exploration, he had
forgotten where the skeletons had been buried. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
even if his account be true in the minutest detail, it
does not afford a shadow of evidence in favour of
the cave having been a place of sepulchre in palæolithic
times, but merely that it had been so used at
some time or another. If we turn to the diagram constructed
by M. Lartet to illustrate his views (“Ann. des
Sc. Nat. Zool.,” 4<sup>e</sup> sér., t. xv., pl. 10), and made for
the most part from Bonnemaison’s recollections; or to
the amended diagram (<a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>) given by Sir Charles
Lyell (“Antiquity of Man,” 1st ed., Fig. 25), we shall see
that the skeletons are depicted <em>above</em> the stratum (<i>b</i>) containing
the palæolithic implements and pleistocene mammalia;
and therefore, according to the laws of geological
evidence, they must have been buried after the subjacent
deposit was accumulated. The previous disturbance
of the cave-earth does away with the conclusion,
that the few human bones found by M. Lartet are
of the same age as the extinct mammalia in the deposit.
The absence of charcoal inside was quite as likely to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
due to the fact that a fire kindled inside would fill
the grotto with smoke, while outside the palæolithic
savage could feast in comfort, as to the view that the
ashes are those of funereal feasts in honour of the
dead within, held after the slab had been placed at the
entrance. The absence of the remains of hyænas from
the interior is also negative evidence, disproved by
subsequent examination.</p>

<p>The researches of the Rev. S.&nbsp;W. King, in 1865, complete
the case against the current view of the palæolithic
character of the interments, since they show that M.
Lartet did not fully explore the cave, and that he consequently
wrote without being in possession of all the
facts. The entrance was blocked up, according to Bonnemaison,
by a slab of stone, which, if the measurements
of the entrance be correct, must have been at least nine
feet long and seven feet high, placed, according to M.
Lartet, to keep the hyænas from the corpses of the dead.
It need hardly be remarked, that the access of these
bone-eating animals to the cave would be altogether incompatible
with the preservation of the human skeletons,
had they been buried at the same time. The enormous
slab was never seen by M. Lartet, and it did not keep
out the hyænas. In the collection made by the Rev. S.
W. King from the interior there are two hyænas’ teeth,
and nearly all the antlers and bones bear the traces of
the gnawing of these animals. The cave, moreover, has
<em>two</em> entrances instead of one, as M. Lartet supposed
when his paper in the “Annales” was published. The
bones of the sheep, or goat, also obtained from the
inside, and preserved in the Christy Museum, afford
strong evidence that the interment is not palæolithic;
and a fragment of pottery, agreeing exactly with that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
used in the neolithic age, probably indicates its relative
antiquity. This conclusion has also been arrived at by the
two most recent explorers, MM. Cartaillac and Gautier.</p>

<p>The skeletons, therefore, in the Aurignac cave cannot
be taken to be of the same age as the stratum on which
they rested; but, so far as there is any evidence, may
probably be referred to the neolithic age, in which the
custom of burial in caves prevailed throughout Europe.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_108"><i>Cavern of Bruniquel.</i></h3>

<p>The famous cavern of Bruniquel, explored by the
Vicomte de Lastic in 1863&ndash;4,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> and described by Professor
Owen, is also one of the class which has furnished
human bones, along with the remains of the extinct
mammalia. It penetrates a cliff in the Jurassic limestone,
opposite the little village of Bruniquel (Tarn and
Garonne), about forty feet above the level of the river
Aveyron. The bottom was covered with a sheet of
stalagmite, resting on earth and blocks of stone, for the
most part finely cemented into a breccia, that is black
with the particles of carbon constituting the “limon
noir” of the workmen, four or five feet thick, beneath
which is the “limon rouge,” or red earth without
charcoal, from three to four feet thick. Every part of
the breccia is charged with the broken remains of the
wolf, rhinoceros, horse, reindeer, stag, Irish elk and bison,
and palæolithic implements of flint and bone; some of
the latter having well-executed designs of the heads of
horses and reindeer, which prove that the cave had
been used as a place of habitation by the hunters of
those animals. Imbedded in the breccia at a depth
of from three to five feet human bones were met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
with, and in two recesses several individuals, including
a child, were found, one of which Professor Owen and
the Vicomte de Lastic disinterred with sufficient care
to prove that the body had been buried in the crouching
posture. The only calvarium sufficiently perfect to
allow of a comparison belonged to the dolicho-cephalic
type, and was very fairly developed.</p>

<p>Professor Owen infers, from the intimate association
of the human bones with the palæolithic implements
and mammalia, that the cave of Bruniquel was used
as a burial-place by the same people who had used
it for habitation, and advances, in support of this, that
the bones of man and of the animals are exactly in the
same state of preservation, having lost the same amount
of gelatine. The evidence, however, does not seem to
be altogether conclusive. If the interment had been
made after the palæolithic inhabitants had forsaken the
cave, the association of the human bones with the
refuse bones in their old refuse-heap must inevitably
have taken place. And if, further, water charged with
carbonate of lime percolated the mass, it would be converted
into a hard breccia, and ultimately covered with
a sheet of stalagmite. This calcification may have taken
place in modern times. A modern bone, as Mr. Evans
has observed in the case of Aurignac, may lose its
gelatine in a comparatively short time, and become
chemically identical with those which have been imbedded
in the same matrix for long ages. The
mineral condition, therefore, is an uncertain test of
relative antiquity.</p>

<p>For these reasons it seems to be doubtful whether the
interment is of the same age as the occupation. The
skull-shape, and the burial in the crouching posture,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
point rather in the direction of the long-headed race,
that buried their dead in caves, in the neolithic age,
in France, Spain, Belgium, and Great Britain.</p>

<p>It forms one of a group of caves at various heights
above the Vezère, which are very well represented in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
the preceding figure, which I am kindly allowed to
borrow from the “Reliquiæ Aquitanicæ” (Fig. 39).</p>

<p>At the time of its discovery in 1868, in the course of
making an embankment for the railway close by, and
of obtaining material for mending the roads, it was
completely blocked up. On the removal of this (<i>b</i>),
by the contractors MM. Bertoú-Meyroú and Delmarés,
the entrance was exposed, and human remains and
worked flints revealed, which were carefully exhumed
in the presence of MM. Laganne, Galy, and Simon.
At this stage of the exploration M. Louis Lartet
was deputed, by the Minister of Public Instruction, to
superintend the work, and from his report the following
account is taken (Lartet and Christy, “Rel. Aq.,” p. 66)
by the courtesy of the editors.</p>

<p>“The cave of Cro-Magnon is formed by a projecting
ledge of cretaceous limestone (rich with fossil corals
and polyzoans), having a thickness of 8 metres and a
length of 17 metres (<a href="#Fig_72">Fig. 72</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">P</span>). The bed which it
overlies, and the destruction of which has given rise to the
cave, abounds with <i class="taxonomy">Rhynchonella vespertilio</i>, which is a
type fossil, fixing the geological horizon. The débris of
this marly and micaceous limestone had accumulated on
the original floor of the cavern to a great thickness, at
least for 0·70 metres (see <a href="#Fig_72">Fig. 72</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>), when the hunters
of the reindeer stopped here for the first time, leaving as
a trace of their short stay a blackish layer (<a href="#Fig_72">Fig. 72</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>),
from 0·05 to 0·15 metre thick, containing worked
flints, bits of charcoal, broken or calcined bones, and
in its upper portion the elephant tusk before alluded
to (<a href="#Fig_72">Fig. 72</a>, <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>“This first hearth is covered by a layer (<span class="smcap smaller">C</span>), 0·25 metre
thick, of calcareous débris, detached bit by bit from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
roof, during the temporary disuse of the shelter. Then
follows another thin layer of hearth-stuff (<span class="smcap smaller">D</span>), 0·10
metre thick, also containing pieces of charcoal, bones,
and worked flints. This bed is in its turn overlain by a
layer of fallen limestone rubbish (<span class="smcap smaller">E</span>), 0·50 metre thick.
Lastly, there is over these a series of more important
layers, all of them containing, in different proportions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
charcoal, bones (broken, burnt, and worked), worked
flints (of different types, but chiefly scrapers), flint cores,
and pebbles of quartz, granites, &amp;c. from the bed of the
Vezère, and bearing numerous marks of hammering.
Altogether these layers seem to have reference to a
period during which the cave was inhabited, if not continuously,
at least at intervals so short as not to admit
of intercalations of débris falling from the roof between
the different hearth-layers which correspond with the
successive phases of this (the third) period of habitation.
The first (lowest) of these layers (<span class="smcap smaller">F</span>) is full of charcoal,
and has a thickness of 0·20 metre; it does not touch the
back of the cave, but extends a little further than the
earlier layers. At its line of contact with the calcareous
débris beneath, the latter is strongly reddened with the
action of fire.</p>

<p>“On the last-mentioned hearth-layer is a bed of
unctuous reddish earth (<span class="smcap smaller">G</span>), 0·30 metre thick, containing
similar objects, though in less quantities. Last in
succession is a carbonaceous bed (<span class="smcap smaller">H</span>), the widest and
thickest of all, having an average thickness of 0·30
metre; at the edges it is only 0·10 metre thick; but
in the centre, where it cuts into the subjacent deposits,
which were excavated by the inhabitants in making the
principal hearth, it attains a depth of 1·60 metre. This
bed, being by far the richest in pieces of charcoal, in
bones, pebbles of quartz, worked flints, flint cores, and
bone implements, such as points or dart-heads, arrowheads,
&amp;c., may be regarded as indicative of a far more
prolonged habitation than the previous.</p>

<p>“Above this thick hearth-layer is a bed of yellowish
earth (<span class="smcap smaller">I</span>), rather argillaceous, also containing bones, flints,
and implements of bone, as well as amulets or pendants.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
This appears to be limited upwards by a carbonaceous
bed (<span class="smcap smaller">J</span>), very thin, and of little extent, 0·05 metre thick,
which M. Laganne observed before my arrival, but of
which only slight traces remained afterwards.</p>

<p>“It was on the upper part of this yellow band (<span class="smcap smaller">I</span>), and
at the back of the cave, that the human skeletons and
the accessories of the sepulture were met with; and all
of them were found in the calcareous débris (<span class="smcap smaller">K</span>), except
in a small space in the furthest hollow at the back of
the cave. This last deposit also contains some worked
flints, mixed up with broken bones, and with some uninjured
bones referable to small rodents and to a peculiar
kind of fox.</p>

<p>“Lastly, above these different layers, and all over the
shelter itself, lay the rubbish of the talus (four to six
metres thick), sufficient in itself, according to what we
have said above about its mode of formation, to carry
back the date of the sepulture to a very distant period
in the prehistoric age.</p>

<p>“As for the human remains, and the position they
occupied in bed <span class="smcap smaller">I</span>, the following are the results of my
careful inquiries in the matter. At the back of the cave
was found an old man’s skull (<i>b</i>), which alone was on
a level with the surface, in the cavity not filled up in
the back of the cave, and was therefore exposed to the
calcareous drip from the roof, as is shown by its having
a stalagmitic coating on some parts. The other human
bones, referable to four other skeletons, were found
around the first, within a radius of about 1·50 metre.
Among these bones were found, on the left of the old
man, the skeleton of a woman, whose skull presents in
front a deep wound, made by a cutting instrument, but
which did not kill her at once, as the bone has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
partly repaired within; indeed our physicians think that
she survived several weeks. By the side of the woman’s
skeleton was that of an infant which had not arrived at
its full time of fœtal development. The other skeletons
(<a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>, <i>d</i>) seem to have been those of men.</p>

<p>“Amidst the human remains lay a multitude of
marine shells (about 300), each pierced with a hole,
and nearly all belonging to the species <i class="taxonomy">Littorina littorea</i>
so common on our Atlantic coasts. Some other species,
such as <i class="taxonomy">Purpura lapillus</i>, <i class="taxonomy">Turritella communis</i>, &amp;c.,
occur, but in small numbers. These are also perforated,
and, like the others, have been used for necklaces,
bracelets, or other ornamental attire. Not far from the
skeletons, I found a pendant or amulet of ivory, oval,
flat, and pierced with two holes. M. Laganne had
already discovered a smaller specimen; and M. Ch.
Grenier, schoolmaster at Les Eyzies, has kindly given
me another, quite similar, which he had received from
one of his pupils. There were also found near the
skeletons several perforated teeth, a large block of
gneiss, split and presenting a large smoothed surface;
also worked antlers of reindeer, and chipped flints, of
the same types as those found in the hearth-layers
underneath.</p>

<p>“... The presence, at all levels, of the same kind
of flint scrapers, as finely chipped as those of the Gorge
d’Enfer, and of the same animals as in that classic
station, evidently shows them to be relics of the successive
habitation of the Cro-Magnon shelter by the
same race of nomadic hunters, who at first could use
it merely as a rendezvous, where they came to share the
spoils of the chase taken in the neighbourhood; but
coming again, they made a more permanent occupation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
until their accumulated refuse and the débris gradually
raised the floor of the cave, leaving the inconvenient
height of only 1·20 metre between it and the roof;
and then they abandoned it by degrees, returning once
more at last to conceal their dead there. No longer
accessible, except perhaps to the foxes above noticed,
this shelter, and its strange sepulture, were slowly and
completely hidden from sight by atmospheric degradation
bringing down the earthy covering, which, by its
thickness, alone proves the great antiquity of the burial
in the cave.”</p>

<p>These conclusions as to the age of the burial do not
seem to me to be supported by the facts of the case. That
the cave was inhabited by a tribe of palæolithic hunters
there can be no doubt, but no evidence has been brought
forward that it was used by them for the burial of their
dead. They “abandoned it by degrees,” but what proof
is there that <em>they</em> “returned once more to conceal their
dead”? The interments are at a higher horizon than the
strata of occupation, and therefore later, and although
palæolithic implements have been found “near” them,
the value of the latter, in indicating the date, is destroyed
by their occurrence throughout the old floors below.
If we suppose that long after the cave had been inhabited
by the hunters of the reindeer, it was chosen by
a family as a burial-place, all the conditions of the discovery
will be satisfied. The pre-existent strata would
be disturbed in the process of burial, and the burrowing
of foxes, and possibly of rabbits, might bring the palæolithic
implements into close association with the human
bones. Taking the whole evidence into account, I should
feel inclined to assign the interment to the neolithic
age, in which cave-burial was so common; but whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
view be held, the facts do not warrant the human
skeletons being taken as proving the physique of the
palæolithic hunters of the Dordogne, or as a basis for an
inquiry into the ethnology of the palæolithic races.</p>

<p>The largest cranium (see Table, <a href="#list_236">p. 236</a>), belonging to
an old man, had the frontal region well developed, is
orthognathic, with upturned nasals, and dolicho-cephalic.
The occipital protuberance, or probole, is small. The
bones of the extremity imply a stature of not less than
five foot eleven inches for the man; the femur is carinate,
and the tibiæ platycnemic (see <a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 48</a>).</p>

<h3 id="hdr_110"><i>The Cave of Lombrive.</i></h3>

<p>The human bones, obtained by MM. Garrigou, Filhol,
and Rames, from the cave of Lombrive<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> in the Department
of Ariège, are, equally with those cited above, of
doubtful antiquity. They were discovered on the superficial
sandy loam, passing in places into a calcareous
breccia, which rests at various levels in the chambers,
passages, and fissures, along with bones of the brown-bear,
urus, small ox, reindeer, stag, horse, and dog.
From the occurrence of the reindeer the deposit is
assigned to the palæolithic age. But since this animal
has been proved to have been eaten in Scotland by the
neolithic men of Caithness, and to have inhabited Britain
in the prehistoric age, it is by no means improbable that
it may also have lived in the region of the Pyrenees in
post-pleistocene times. The presence of the dog and the
small domestic ox (<i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons?</i>) fixes the date of
the accumulation as not being earlier than prehistoric;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
for both those animals were introduced into Europe by
neolithic peoples.</p>

<p>The two human skulls, described by Professor Vogt,
from this deposit confirm this conclusion, since they are
of the broad type, and differ in no important character
(Thurnam) from those of the neolithic brachy-cephali of
France and Belgium.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_111"><i>The Cave of Cavillon, near Mentone.</i></h3>

<p>The cave of Cavillon, explored by M. Rivière, in 1872,
in the neighbourhood of Mentone, a few hundred yards on
the Italian side of the frontier of France, is another case
of the occurrence of human remains in association with
those of the extinct animals. The floor is composed of
dark earth, full of charcoal and fragments of bones,
mingled with blocks of stone which have dropped from
the roof. Below it, at a depth of six and a half metres,
a skeleton was met with, as well as flint-flakes, rude
instruments of bone, and a number of shells perforated
for suspension. The skull was covered with a head-dress
of more than 200 perforated sea-shells. It rested in an
attitude of repose, with the legs and arms bent,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> as may
be seen in the admirable photo-lithograph given by M.
Rivière in the volume of the “International Congress of
Prehistoric Archæology,” published at Brussels, pl. 6.
The teeth and bones of hyæna, lion, woolly rhinoceros,
mammoth, and other pleistocene animals occurred both
in the soil above and below, and for that reason both the
discoverer and Sir Charles Lyell believe that the interment
dates back to the time when those animals were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
living. If, however, neolithic savages, or those of a later
age, had buried the skeleton in the earth containing the
extinct animals, all the circumstances which have been
noticed, either by Mr. Pengelly or Mr. Moggridge,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> may
be satisfactorily explained. There are no stalagmites
to divide one stratum from another, and were an interment
made in the cave at the present time, the
discoverer two or three centuries hence might assert,
with equal justice, that it took place in the pleistocene
age, because of the association with the animals characteristic
of that remote period.</p>

<p>The superficial portions of the cave-earth had certainly
been disturbed, and there is no evidence that the
disturbance did not extend down to the horizon where
the skeleton rested. Nevertheless, Mr. Pengelly concludes
that the interment is of palæolithic age from its
analogy with that of Cro-Magnon and Paviland, which
we have seen to be of equally doubtful antiquity. It
seems to me that this conclusion, which is almost universally
accepted, is not warranted by the facts, and that
it cannot be used in support of any speculation as to the
condition of man in the pleistocene age.</p>

<p>The skull is described by M. Rivière as long, the
thigh-bones are strongly carinate, and the tibiæ are
platycnemic as in the case of those from Cro-Magnon,
Gibraltar, Sclaigneaux, and North Wales.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_112"><i>Grotta dei Colombi in Island of Palmaria, inhabited
by Cannibals.</i></h3>

<p>We are indebted to Professor Capellini for an account
of the exploration of the Grotta dei Colombi, a cave in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
vertical cliff in the island of Palmaria,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> overlooking to
the south the Gulf of Spezzia. In the red loam, composing
the floor, were numerous flakes and scrapers, a
rounded “striker” of Saussurite, quartz, pebbles, fragments
of pottery, a bone needle, a whistle made of the
first phalange of a goat’s foot, shells perforated for
suspension, <i class="taxonomy">Natica mille-punctata</i>, <i class="taxonomy">Pectunculus glycimeris</i>,
and <i class="taxonomy">Patella cærulea</i>, together with bones of
goat, hog, ox, wolf, wild cat, and broken and cut human
bones belonging to children and young adults.</p>

<p>Among the remains Professor Capellini draws attention
in particular to the thigh-bones, scorched by fire, one of
which bears incisions on its posterior face made by a flint
implement in cutting away the flesh (Pl. 73, <i>a</i>), and is
also marked by scraping. He considers that they belong
to an ape, closely allied to the <i class="taxonomy">Macacus innuus</i> of Gibraltar
and North Africa, and concludes, therefore, that the
animal was living in Palmaria at the time that the
cave was inhabited. This identification is forbidden
by the spongy texture, the rounded contour, and the
absence of epiphyses that imply that the bone was very
young, and that in the adult it would be far larger than
any thigh-bone of the apes. On comparing his figures
with eight femora belonging to young children, from the
cairn at Cefn, and the caves at Perthi-Chwareu, I find
that they agree in every particular with two, the flattening
of the inferior extremity, considered by Prof.
Calori to be a non-human character, being equally met
with in all, and being relatively greater in the younger
than the older. They offer, therefore, unmistakeable
proof that the inhabitants of the cave were cannibals
(<a href="#Fig_73">Fig. 73</a>). I am informed by my friend, Prof. Busk,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
that the bone figured belonged
to a child about eight years
old. The outline <i>b</i> in the
figure represents the contour
of one of the femora from the
cavern at Cefn, described in
the <a href="#CHAPTER_V">fifth</a> chapter.</p>

<div id="Fig_73" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p>In this cave, as in those
quoted above, there are no
polished stone implements, or
works of art, that establish
that these feasts were carried
on in the cave by neolithic
cannibals, for the rude flint-flakes
and bone articles, taken
by Professor Capellini to fix
its date, are common both to
the palæolithic and the bronze
ages. Nevertheless, since the
inhabitants have left behind
no trace of any metal, and
since their food was wholly
supplied by the existing animals,
they were probably in
the neolithic stage of culture,
if this be taken to
cover the wide interval extending
from the pleistocene
to the age of bronze. They
are proved, by the rudeness
of their implements, to have
been savages of a very low
order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
We may gather from various allusions, and stories
scattered through the classical writers, such for example
as that of the Cyclops, that the caves on the shores
of the Mediterranean were inhabited by cannibals in
ancient times. In the island of Palmaria we meet
with unmistakeable proof that it was no mere idle
tale or poetical dream. But we have no proof that
cannibalism was universally practised at any stage in
the history of man. All the caves of Europe, explored
up to the present time, merely afford some three or four
examples in the neolithic and bronze ages. In the
pleistocene there is no instance which is devoid of
doubt. This atrocious practice is therefore to be viewed
as abnormal, and it probably became ingrafted into the
religious ideas of the nations of antiquity from the
horror by which it was surrounded, ultimately surviving
in the form of human sacrifices to the offended gods.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_113"><i>General Conclusions as to Prehistoric Caves.</i></h3>

<p>We have seen in the <a href="#CHAPTER_V">fifth</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">sixth</a> chapters that
the prehistoric caves which are so unimportant in the
ages of bronze and iron, were used in the neolithic
age throughout western Europe both for habitation
and burial, and that they therefore offer us most
valuable materials for working out the ethnology of
Europe at that remote time. The two races of men,
the remains of which they contain, are represented
by the modern Basque and Berber on the one hand,
and on the other by the Celt, and in Russia and
Germany by the cognate Finn, Sclave, and Wend.
And since all the human remains described in the
present chapter, those of Cro-Magnon and possibly of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
the Grotta dei Colombi being exempted, belong to one
of other of these types, they may be referred to the neolithic
age with a high degree of probability. In the
present stage of the inquiry, it is much safer to put
them into a distinct class, apart from those to which we
can assign a relative age with tolerable certainty.</p>

<p>In the long ages which elapsed between the close
of the pleistocene period and the dawn of history
other races than these may have occupied Europe,
and have passed away without leaving any clue as
to their identity. But in the present state of our
knowledge we are justified only in concluding, that
the oldest population in prehistoric times was non-Aryan,
the traces of which are left behind not merely
in the caves and tombs, but in language,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> and in the
small dark-haired inhabitants of western and southern
Europe.</p>

<p>The prehistoric peoples lived under physical conditions
very different from those of central and
western Europe at the present time; the surface of the
country being covered with rock, forest, and morass,
which afforded shelter to the elk, bison, urus, stag,
megaceros, and wild boar, as well as to innumerable
wolves. They arrived from the east with cereals and
domestic animals, some of which, such as the <i class="taxonomy">Bos
longifrons</i> and <i class="taxonomy">Sus palustris</i>, reverted to their original
wild state. From the very exigencies of their position
they lived partly by hunting, and they gradually pushed
their way westward, carrying with them the rudiments
of that civilization which we ourselves possess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
It is an open question whether they came into contact
with the palæolithic races which preceded them.</p>

<p>The climate which they enjoyed was sufficiently severe
to allow the reindeer to inhabit the district on which
now stands the city of London, and its severity may also
be inferred from the thickness of the bark of the Scotch
firs, observed by Mr. Godwin-Austen in the submarine
forests of the south of England, and by Mr. James
Geikie in those of Scotland. The area of Great Britain
was greater then, than now, since a plain extended
seawards from the coast-line, nearly everywhere, supporting
a dense forest of Scotch fir, oak, birch, and
alder, the relics of which are to be seen in the beds
of peat, and the stumps of the trees, near low-water
mark on most of our shores. And it may be inferred
that the forest extended a considerable distance from
the present sea margin, from the large size of the
trunks of the trees.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span><a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_114"><i>Relation of Pleistocene to Prehistoric Period.</i></h3>

<p class="in0">We have seen, in the <a href="#CHAPTER_V">fifth</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">sixth</a> chapters, that the
caves offer valuable information as to the prehistoric
ethnology of Europe, and that they prove the ancient
neolithic population to stand directly related to the
Basque and Celtic elements in the present inhabitants of
Britain, France, and Spain. We shall discover in the
course of this and the following chapters that no such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
continuity can be made out between the palæolithic
man of the pleistocene age and any of the races now
living in our quarter of the world; and we shall see
that he is separated from his neolithic successor by
an interval of time, the length of which cannot be
measured in terms of years. Before the pleistocene
group of caves be examined, it will be necessary to
define the relation that exists between the prehistoric
and the pleistocene periods.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_115"><i>The Animals&mdash;Magnitude of Interval.</i></h3>

<p id="hdr_116">The prehistoric mammalia consist, as we have seen
(p.&nbsp;136), with the solitary exception of the Irish elk, of
the wild animals at present living in Europe, together
with the domestic species and varieties introduced by
man, probably from central Asia. In the rest of this
work we shall have to deal, not merely with the wild
animals at present inhabiting Europe, but also with
those which have either become extinct, or have migrated
to Asia, America, or Africa. Besides this addition to
the European fauna in the pleistocene age, the total
absence of the domestic animals is a most important
feature. The dog, goat, sheep, Celtic short-horn, and
domestic swine are conspicuous by their absence: the
reputed association of their remains with those of the
pleistocene mammals being due, in all the cases which
I have examined in France and Britain, to a confusion
between distinct strata in the same cave or river-deposit,
which are respectively of pleistocene and prehistoric or
historic ages. Thus in the excavations in the gravel
underneath London, the Celtic short-horn and goat of
the superficial strata are very generally mixed with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
reindeer and mammoth of the pleistocene gravels below,
by the collectors, and the names of the domestic animals
have crept into the pleistocene lists. None of the domestic
animals have been recorded from any carefully explored
strata of that age in any part of Europe.</p>

<p>The following late pleistocene species were unknown
in Britain in the prehistoric <span class="locked">age:&mdash;</span></p>

<p id="list_266" class="in0 in4">
Glutton.<br />
Spotted hyæna.<br />
Panther.<br />
Lion.<br />
Lynx.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">Felis Caffer.</i><br />
Musk-sheep.<br />
Bison.<br />
Hippopotamus.<br />

<i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros hemitœchus.</i><br />
<i class="taxonomy">R. tichorhinus.</i><br />
<i class="taxonomy">Elephas antiquus.</i><br />
Mammoth.
</p>

<p>The glutton, lynx, bison, and lemming, still live in
Europe, the spotted hyæna, <i class="taxonomy">Felis Caffer</i>, and hippopotamus
are peculiar to Africa, the lion to Africa and Asia,
and the last seven species are extinct. The <i class="taxonomy">Machairodus
cultridens</i> and <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros megarhinus</i> probably disappeared
in an early stage of the pleistocene. It may
reasonably be inferred, from the migration and extinction
of so many species between the close of the pleistocene
and beginning of the historic period, that the interval
was of considerable length; for it would be impossible
for such changes to have taken place in a short time.</p>

<p>The same sharp line of demarcation exists between
the two faunas on the continent. The panther, <i class="taxonomy">Felis
Caffer</i>, lynx, spotted hyæna, musk-sheep, hippopotamus,
and the extinct group disappeared. The African elephant
forsook Spain and Sicily, the striped hyæna the south of
France, before the prehistoric period; while the <i class="taxonomy">Elephas
meridionalis</i> and pigmy hippopotamus of Sicily, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the pigmy elephant and gigantic dormouse of Malta,
became extinct. Speaking in general terms, the wild
fauna of Europe, as we have it now, dates from the
beginning of the prehistoric age, and consists merely of
those animals which were able to survive the changes
by which their pleistocene congeners were banished or
destroyed. The arrival of the domestic animals under
the care of man in the neolithic age, and their extension
over the whole of Europe in a wild or semi-wild state,
coupled with the disappearance of the wild species mentioned
above, constitutes a change in the mammal life
at least as important as any of those which define the
meiocene from the pleiocene, or the pleiocene from the
pleistocene periods.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_117"><i>Physical changes&mdash;The excavation and filling up of Valleys.</i></h3>

<p id="hdr_118">The magnitude of the interval between the two
periods may also be gathered from the great changes
which have taken place in physical geography. In
nearly every valley in Great Britain, certain areas to
be mentioned presently excepted, are strata of sand
and gravel, proved to be of pleistocene age by their
fossil mammals, and by their fluviatile shells to have
been deposited by rivers. They occur at various heights,
forming sometimes terraces, and at others isolated
patches, which were accumulated when the river flowed
at their level, and before the valleys were cut down to
their present depth. Those at Fisherton near Salisbury,
described by Sir Charles Lyell, Mr. Prestwich, Mr. John
Evans,<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> and others, may be taken as an example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<div id="Fig_74" class="figcenter" style="width: 477px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>&mdash;Section of Valley-gravels at Fisherton. (Evans.)</div></div>

<p>The valley through which the river Wily flows is
excavated in the chalk (<a href="#Fig_74">Fig. 74</a>), and on its northern side
fluviatile deposits occur at two levels, represented in
the accompanying section. One patch of gravel, about
twelve feet thick, <i>a</i>, lies about eighty feet above the
present level of the Wily; while a second, <i>b</i>, consisting
of clayey brickearth or loam, with seams of gravel, and
fluviatile shells, sweeps down from a lower point to the
bottom of the valley, and passes under the river. From
the deposit <i>a</i>, Dr. Blackmore obtained many rudely-chipped
implements, of the same palæolithic type as
those found with the extinct mammalia in the gravel
beds at Amiens and Abbeville in the valley of the
Somme. In the deposit <i>b</i>, fossil mammalia were met
with belonging to the following <span class="locked">animals:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0 in4">
Spotted hyæna.<br />
Lion.<br />
Reindeer.<br />
Stag.<br />
Bison.<br />
Urus.<br />
Musk-sheep.<br />
Wild boar.<br />
Horse.<br />
Woolly rhinoceros.<br />
Mammoth.<br />
Lemming.<br />
Pouched marmot.<br />
Hare.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Dr. Blackmore subsequently discovered a flint implement
along with these animals, of the same type as those
previously met with in the deposit <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>A horizontal stretch of alluvium, <i>c</i>, deposited by the
floods, occupies the present bottom of the valley. In
this section it is plain that the gravels and brickearth at
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> were deposited by a river, which formerly flowed
at those levels. In other words, the valley of the Wily was
excavated during the time that the pleistocene strata <i>a</i>
and <i>b</i> were being formed, while palæolithic man and
the extinct animals were living in the neighbourhood.
The position also of <i>b</i> below the present bottom of the
valley proves that the latter then was deeper than it is
now. The prehistoric alluvium, <i>c</i>, represents the last
stage in the history of the valley in which it is beginning
to be filled with the deposits of floods. While it was
being accumulated none of the animals of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> were
living in the district except the hare, urus, stag, horse,
and wild boar.</p>

<p id="hdr_119">A somewhat similar section is exposed in the valley of
the Avon at Freshford, near Bath, in a railway cutting,
at a height of about thirty-five feet above the river. A
thick mass of gravel abuts directly against a cleft of inferior
oolite (<a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a>), and gradually dies down to the alluvium.
In it Mr. Charles Moore discovered the remains of the
musk-sheep, and the Rev. H.&nbsp;H. Winwood those of the
mammoth, bison, horse, and reindeer. In this case the
pleistocene strata occupied the side of one of the valleys
which had been deepened since the time of their deposit.</p>

<div id="Fig_75" class="figcenter" style="width: 717px;">
  <img src="images/i_270.jpg" width="717" height="350" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span>&mdash;Section of Valley-gravels at Freshford, Bath.<br />
  4, Red loam, 5ft. 6in.; 3, Oolitic wash, 1ft.; 2, Clay with flints, 4ft. 10in.; 1, Gravel with fossil mammals, 8ft.</div></div>

<p>The alluvium in the neighbourhood of Bath contains
in its lower portion a layer of peat, with bones of the
Celtic short-horn (<i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>), stag, roe, horse, goat,
and pig; and in its upper part are old refuse heaps,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
proved to be Roman by the coins and ware, which
are also met with at various points underneath the
surface soil, and sometimes at considerable depths.
It is, therefore, of prehistoric and historic age, and since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
it is found only in the valley bottoms, we may conclude
that the present courses of the rivers along the sides
of which it is found date back from the prehistoric age;
while their ancient courses are marked by the fluviatile
deposits with the extinct mammalia standing at various
levels, the higher being the older. In the section at
Fisherton we have evidence that the river flowed at a
lower level in the pleistocene age than in the prehistoric,
and in that at Freshford that the lower portion of the
valley had been excavated after the pleistocene strata
had been formed. One or other of these physical changes
is to be traced in nearly all river valleys.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> We may
conclude that both imply a considerable lapse of time,
because similar changes are now produced with extreme
slowness. In the pleistocene river deposits, which lie
scattered about at various heights on the valley sides,
we seek in vain for neolithic implements, or domestic
animals. In the low-lying alluvia, and accumulations
of peat, we seek equally in vain for traces of palæolithic
man, or of the extinct mammalia, except the
Irish elk.</p>

<p>We may also gather, from the localization of the prehistoric
alluvia close to the present streams, that the
time represented by its accumulation is insignificant
in comparison with the long lapse of ages implied by
the pleistocene gravels and brickearths, that were deposited
at various heights during the excavation of the
valleys. The general surface of the valleys has undergone
but little change since history began, and the
excavation by the rivers has been so small as to have
escaped accurate measurement. The alluvia represent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
the principal work done since the close of the pleistocene
period.</p>

<p>The most important testimony that the interval between
the two periods was very long, is offered by the
climatal change, and the severance of Britain from the
continent. The arctic severity of the pleistocene winter
in these latitudes had passed away before the prehistoric
age, and the pleistocene valleys of the North Sea, St.
George’s Channel, the British, and Irish Channels had
been depressed beneath the waves of the sea before any
prehistoric strata yet known had been deposited. The
evidence that these changes actually took place must be
referred to the two following chapters.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_120"><i>Comparison of Deposits in Valleys with those in Caves.</i></h3>

<p>If these valley deposits be compared with the contents
of some of the bone caves, such, for example, as
those of the Victoria Cave (compare <a href="#Fig_74">Figs. 74</a> and <a href="#Fig_75">75</a>
with <a href="#Fig_20">Figs. 20</a>, <a href="#Fig_21">21</a>, <a href="#Fig_29">29</a>), it will be seen that they present
the same section. The pleistocene gravels and brick-earths
of the one correspond with the lower strata of the
other, and contain the same extinct animals. The prehistoric
alluvium of the one is represented by the layer
containing neolithic bronze or iron implements, as well
as the same animals; while the historic strata are
represented in both by the superficial accumulations.
The only difference indeed between the one and the
other is, that in the former the strata of the three
periods are spread over a wide area, while in the
latter they are super-imposed in vertical order, the
pleistocene below, the prehistoric in the middle, and
the historic on the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_121"><i>Difference in Mineral Condition of Deposits in Caves.</i></h3>

<p>The prehistoric, and the historic strata in caves differ
from the pleistocene in their physical constitution. They
are darker in colour, and more loosely stratified, and
contain bones in a more friable and less mineralized
condition, and are more free from stalagmite.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_122"><i>The Caves of Germany: Gailenreuth.</i></h3>

<p>The use of fossil bones for medicinal purposes led, as
I have already mentioned in the <a href="#CHAPTER_I">first</a> chapter, to the
exploration of caves, which were first scientifically examined
in Germany towards the close of the eighteenth
century. They abound in all the limestone plateaux,
especially in the region of Franconia, and in that of the
Hartz. Among them the most interesting, perhaps, is
that of Gailenreuth, explored by Esper, Rosenmüller,
Goldfuss, Buckland, Lord Enniskillen, and Sir Philip
Egerton. It penetrates a lofty cliff, that forms a side of
the deep gorge which the river Weissent has cut in the
rock, at a point about three hundred feet above the
water level.</p>

<p>The entrance, Dr. Buckland<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> writes, is about seven
feet high and twelve feet broad, and within it a short
passage leads into two chambers (<a href="#Fig_76">Fig. 76</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>),<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> hung
with stalactites, and with the floors covered by a dense
stalagmitic pavement, that has been more or less broken
up by repeated diggings. These floors are perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
horizontal, the level of that of <span class="smcap smaller">B</span> being considerably
below that of <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>. They rest on an accumulation of
reddish grey loam, containing pebbles, and angular
limestone blocks, and vast quantities of the bones and
teeth of the animals formerly living in the district. The
depth of this ossiferous deposit has not been ascertained,
but in the further end of the chamber <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, it has been
proved to be more than twenty-five feet thick.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span>&mdash;Section of Gailenreuth Cave. (Buckland.)</div></div>

<p>The remains of the animals lie scattered in the wildest
confusion; sometimes being completely matted together,
but more generally each bone is enveloped in earth.
They belong to the lion, the cave variety of the spotted
hyæna, the cave-bear, grizzly bear, mammoth, Irish elk,
and reindeer, as well as to those species which are still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
to be found in Germany, such as the glutton, brown bear,
wolf, fox, and stag.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to account for such an accumulation
as this, but it was probably introduced through
the present entrance, and thence into the chamber <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>,
passing from the higher to the lower levels. The teeth-marks
on the bones show that some of the animals
had formed the prey of the hyænas, but had they
introduced all the bones there would have been distinct
strata marking the floors of occupation, as in
Wookey Hole (<a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>). Moreover, no perfect skulls,
such as those of the bears, would have escaped their
powerful teeth. The pebbles in the loam bear testimony
to the passage of a current of water. And if
we suppose that the cave was subject to floods, such
as those in the water-caves described in the <a href="#CHAPTER_II">second</a>
chapter, the scattering of the bones through the loam
may be explained. This, however, could not have
happened had the cave then opened on the face of
a nearly vertical cliff, and the only condition under
which it would have been possible is, that the present
entrance should have been directly connected with a
stream flowing from the surface, that is to say, over the
space now occupied by the gorge of the Weissent. If
this view, advanced by Dr. Buckland, be accepted, the
remoteness of the date of the filling up of the cave may
be measured by the fact, that since that time the gorge
has been cut down by the Weissent to a depth of more
than 300 feet.</p>

<p>The stream by which the contents of the cave were
introduced had a course probably analogous to that of
Dalebeck (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>) and the remains of the animals were
caught up from the surface, and accumulated in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
subterranean chambers which it traversed. Their abundance
offers no obstacle to this view, since wild animals
frequent their drinking places in vast numbers, and fall
a prey to the carnivora which lurk near the streams,
and very many tumble into the natural pitfalls, or swallow-holes,
so universal in limestone districts.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_123"><i>The Cave of Kühloch.</i></h3>

<p>Very many other caves occur in the neighbourhood,
most of them, such as those of Zahnloch, celebrated for
the abundance of fossil teeth, Mokas, Rabenstein, and
others, of which the cave of Kühloch alone demands
notice.</p>

<p>The cave of Kühloch is situated opposite to the castle
of Rabenstein, in the gorge of the Esbach, at about thirty
feet from the bottom. Its exterior presents a lofty arch
in a nearly perpendicular cliff, about thirty feet wide and
twenty feet high, and the entrance gradually leads into
two large chambers “both of which terminate in a close
round end, or cul-de-sac, at the distance of about 100
feet from the entrance. It is intersected by no fissures,
and has no lateral communications connecting it with
any other caverns, except one small hole close to its
mouth, and which opens also to the valley.” The first
thirty feet present a steep slope towards the entrance.
Dr. Buckland describes the contents of the chambers in
the following words:<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is literally true that in this single cavern (the size
and proportions of which are nearly equal to those of
the interior of a large church) there are hundreds of
cart-loads of black animal dust entirely covering the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
whole floor, to a depth which must average at least six
feet, and which, if we multiply this depth by the length
and breadth of the cavern, will be found to exceed 5,000
cubic feet. The whole of this mass has been again and
again dug over in search of teeth and bones, which it
still contains abundantly, though in broken fragments.
The state of these is very different from that of the
bones we find in any of the other caverns, being of a
black, or, more properly speaking, dark umber colour
throughout, like the bones of mummies, and many of them
readily crumbling under the finger into a soft dark powder
resembling mummy powder, and being of the same
nature with the black earth in which they are embedded.
The quantity of animal matter accumulated on this floor
is the most surprising, and the only thing of the kind
I ever witnessed; and many hundred&mdash;I may say thousand&mdash;individuals
must have contributed their remains to
make up this appalling mass of the dust of death. It
seems in great part to be derived from comminuted and
pulverized bone; for the fleshy parts of animal bodies
produce by their decomposition so small a quantity of
permanent earthy residuum, that we must seek for the
origin of this mass principally in decayed bones. The
cave is so dry, that the black earth lies in the state of
loose powder, and rises in dust under the feet; it also
retains so large a proportion of its original animal matter
that it is occasionally used by the peasants as an enriching
manure for the adjacent meadows. I have stated
that the total quantity of animal matter that lies within
this cavern cannot be computed at less than 5,000 cubic
feet; now allowing two cubic feet of dust and bones for
each individual animal, we shall have in this single
vault the remains of at least 2,500 bears, a number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
which may have been supplied in the space of 1,000
years by a mortality at the rate of two and a half per
annum.”</p>

<p>Dr. Buckland’s explanation, that the cave was inhabited
by bears for long generations, is probably true. The
absence of pebbles and silt show that water had no
share in the introduction of the remains; their preservation
is due to the dryness of the cave, and to its
proximity to the outer atmosphere.</p>

<p>The famous caves of Sundwig, Schartsfeld, and Bauman’s
Hole, belong to the same class as Gailenreuth, and
offer no differences which need be described.</p>

<p>These explorations establish the fact that, in the
antediluvian age which we now term pleistocene, the
lion, the cave-bear and grizzly bear, and cave-hyæna
abounded in Germany, and that they sought as their
prey not merely the wild animals now living in that
region, but the reindeer, mammoth, woolly rhinoceros,
and Irish elk. All the discoveries in the German caves
from the date of the exploration of Gailenreuth have
merely verified this conclusion without adding any new
fact of importance.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_124"><i>The Caves of Great Britain.</i></h3>

<p>These discoveries in the German caves led to the
exploration of those in our country. Dr. Buckland
visited Gailenreuth in 1816, and in 1821 applied the
result of his knowledge gained in Germany to the investigation
of the famous cavern of Kirkdale.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span><a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<h3><i>The Hyæna-den at Kirkdale.</i></h3>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>&mdash;Plan of Kirkdale Cave. (Taylor.)</div></div>

<p id="hdr_125">The cave of Kirkdale (<a href="#Fig_77">Figs. 77</a>, <a href="#Fig_78">78</a>) was discovered in
a quarry in the vale of Pickering, about twenty-five
miles to the NN.E. of York, at a point where the dale
of Holmbeck joins Kirkdale. The entrance, eighty feet
above the valley bottom and twenty feet from the surface
of the plateau above, was about three feet high and six
feet wide, and led into a passage from five to ten feet
wide, which ran nearly horizontally into the rock, and
branched off into smaller ramifications. Its general form
and size may be gathered from the examination of the
accompanying woodcuts, which were published by Mr.
Taylor in “Macmillan’s Magazine,” in September 1862.
The roof was for the most part free from stalactite, and
there was no continuous coating of stalagmite on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
floor, but merely here and there a few calcareous bosses
termed “cows’ paps” by the workmen.</p>

<div id="Fig_78" class="figcenter" style="width: 790px;">
  <img src="images/i_280.jpg" width="790" height="458" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span>&mdash;Sections of Kirkdale Cave. (Taylor.)</div></div>

<p>A layer of fine red loam covered the bottom, in the
lower portions of which were large numbers of gnawed
and broken bones, and teeth, for the most part of the
same species as those formed in the German caves. In
some places they were lying in little confused heaps,
and in others, where the loam was thin, were exposed
to the calcareous drip and cemented into a mass, their
upper portions projecting through the stalagmite “like
the legs of pigeons through pie-crust,” and their irregular
distribution resembling that of the fragments scattered
on the floor of a dog-kennel.</p>

<p>The remains of the animals were incredibly abundant,
when the small space in which they were packed was
taken into consideration. Those of the hyæna are estimated
by Dr. Buckland as belonging to between two or
three hundred individuals of all ages. The lion and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
cave-bear, the wild boar, the hippopotamus (<a href="#Fig_79">Fig. 79</a>) an
extinct kind of elephant (<i class="taxonomy">E. antiquus</i>), and the rhinoceros
named by Dr. Falconer <i class="taxonomy">R. hemitœchus</i>, the reindeer,
and Irish elk are also represented, but the species
of most common occurrence are the bison and the horse.
With a few exceptions all the bones with marrow were
broken, and scarred by teeth, while the solid and marrowless
were more or less perfect.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 79.</span>&mdash;Molar of Hippopotamus. (Buckland.)</div></div>

<p>Dr. Buckland’s method of solving the problem of the
introduction of remains of so many and different animals
into so small a space,
is a model of scientific analysis.
He argues from the
abundance of the remains of
the hyæna, and from the
correspondence of their teeth
with the marks on the bones,
and from the quantity of
their coprolites, that the cave
was inhabited by many generations
of those animals, and
that the gnawed fragments were relics of their prey. The
hyænas of the present day inhabit caves strewn with the
bones of their prey, which are crushed by their powerful
jaws into the same form as those of Kirkdale. He further
demonstrated the truth of his conclusion by the crucial
experiment of subjecting the leg-bone of an ox to a
spotted hyæna from the Cape of Good Hope, in Wombwell’s
Menagerie. “I was able,” he writes,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> “to observe
the animal’s mode of proceeding in the destruction of
bones: the shin-bone of an ox being presented to this
hyæna, he began to bite off with his molar teeth large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
fragments from its upper extremity, and swallowed
them whole as fast as they were broken off. On his
reaching the medullary cavity, the bone split into
angular fragments, many of which he caught up greedily
and swallowed entire: he went on cracking it till he had
extracted all the marrow, licking out the lowest portion
of it with his tongue: this done, he left untouched the
lower condyle, which contains no marrow, and is very
hard. The state and form of this residuary fragment
are precisely like those of similar bones at Kirkdale;
the marks of teeth on it are very few, as the bone usually
gave off a splinter before the large conical teeth had
forced a hole through it; these few, however, entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
resemble the impressions we find on the bones at Kirkdale;
the small splinters also in form and size, and
manner of fracture, are not distinguishable from the
fossil ones. I preserve all the fragments and the gnawed
portions of this bone, for the sake of comparison by the
side of those I have from the antediluvian den in Yorkshire:
there is absolutely no difference between them,
except in point of age. The animal left untouched the
solid bones of the tarsus and carpus, and such parts of
the cylindrical bones as we find untouched at Kirkdale,
and devoured only the parts analogous to those which are
there deficient. The keeper, pursuing this experiment
to its final result, presented me the next morning with
a large quantity of <i class="anatomy">album græcum</i>, disposed in balls,
that agree entirely in size, shape, and substance with
those that were found in the den at Kirkdale. The
power of his jaws far exceeded any animal force of the
kind I ever saw exerted, and reminded me of nothing
so much as of a miner’s crushing mill, or the scissors
with which they cut off bars of iron and copper in the
metal foundries.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span>&mdash;Leg-bones gnawed by Hyænas&mdash;1, of Ox in Menagerie; 2, of Bison in Kirkdale. (Buckland.)</div></div>

<p>The exact correspondence of one of the fragments of
the tibia of an ox, gnawed by the Cape hyæna, with the
corresponding bone of the bison from Kirkdale, may be
gathered from a comparison of the two figured in
<a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a>, in which the teeth-marks <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, are very
distinct. The same kind of identity runs through the
whole series of bones gnawed by the living and fossil
hyænas.</p>

<p>Dr. Buckland’s conclusion, that the Kirkdale cave was
the den of the spotted hyænas (<i class="taxonomy">H. crouta</i>) that preyed
upon the animals of Yorkshire in ancient times, and
that it was undisturbed down to the time of its exploration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
cannot be disputed. The tread of the hyænas in
their passage to and fro had polished some of the bones
and jaws scattered on the floor, and the polished surfaces
were uppermost, the rest of the fragments being rough.
And Prof. Phillips informs me that the leg-bone of a
ruminant was discovered wedged into a small fissure
in the floor, with that portion which was within reach of
the hyæna’s teeth gnawed away, while the rest was
uninjured. The hyæna had lost his bone in the fissure,
and was only able to nibble the end which projected.
In these incidents we have a vivid picture of an hyæna’s
den in Yorkshire during the pleistocene age, with the
contents left in their natural order and not rearranged
by the passage of water.</p>

<p>The Victoria cave near Settle, in Yorkshire, described
in the <a href="#CHAPTER_III">third</a> chapter, has also been occupied by hyænas.</p>

<p>The Dream-cave, near Wirksworth,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> in Derbyshire,
contrasts with that of Kirkdale in the perfect state of
the bones which it contains. It was discovered in 1822,
in following a vein of lead (<a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a>). The miners
suddenly broke into a hollow, <i>c</i>, filled with red earth
and stones, and as they continued their shaft downwards
the sides continually closed upon them until the roof of
a cave was revealed. A nearly perfect skeleton of the
rhinoceros was discovered in the earth, as well as bones
of the horse, reindeer, and urus. After a large quantity
of the earth had been removed, the surface soil, <i>i</i>, at a little
distance began to sink, and ultimately a vertical shaft<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
was found to connect the cave with the surface. Into
this the animals had fallen, just as at the present time
sheep and oxen frequently perish in similar natural pitfalls
in the limestone strata.</p>

<p>Other caves and fissures in Derbyshire have yielded

<h3 id="hdr_127"><i>The Caves of North Wales, near St. Asaph.</i></h3>

<p>The ossiferous caves and fissures at Cefn, near St.
Asaph, in the mountain limestone that forms the south
side of the Vale of Clwyd, were first described in 1833,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>
by the Rev. Edward Stanley, afterwards Bishop of Norwich,
who explored that which Mr. E. Lloyd had discovered
about half-way down the vertical cliff, in the
grounds of Cefn Hall. It consists of a narrow passage,
turning on itself, and communicating with the surface of
the cliff by two entrances, which were completely blocked
up with red silt, containing a vast quantity of bones in
very bad preservation. The bottom has not yet been
reached. In one portion I found, in 1872, a deposit of
comminuted bone with scarcely any mixture of loam,
that rose in clouds of dust as it was disturbed. The
animals belonged to the same class as those of Germany,
the cave-bear, spotted hyæna, and reindeer, as well as
the hippopotamus, <i class="taxonomy">Elephas antiquus</i> and <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros
hemitœchus</i> of the Kirkdale cave. Pebbles derived from
the boulder clay, and rounded waterworn fragments of
bone, showed that the contents had been introduced into
this cave by a stream. Some of the remains, which
were marked with teeth, may have been introduced by
the hyænas. The flint-flakes found with the human
skull and cut antlers of stag, already referred to in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_V">fifth</a> chapter, were discovered in the lower entrance.</p>

<p>The same group of animals has been obtained by Mrs.
Williams Wynn, the Rev. D.&nbsp;R. Thomas, and myself out
of a horizontal cave at the head of the defile leading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
down from Cefn to Pont Newydd, in which the remains
are embedded in a stiff clay, consisting of rearranged
boulder clay, and are in the condition of waterworn
pebbles. From it I have identified the brown, grizzly,
and cave-bear. A further examination by the Rev. D.
R. Thomas, and Prof. Hughes, has recently resulted in
the discovery of rude implements of felstone, and a tooth
which has been identified by Prof. Busk as a human
molar of unusual size.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>A third cave in the neighbourhood at Plas Heaton,
explored in 1870 by Mr. Heaton and Prof. Hughes, furnished
the remains of the cave-bear, spotted hyæna, bison,
and reindeer, and a remarkably fine specimen of the lower
jaw of a glutton (<a href="#Fig_82">Fig. 82</a>), which I have described in the
“Geological Journal” (vol. xxvii. p. 406). In a fourth
cave, at Gallfaenan, the bear and reindeer were discovered.
It is evident from the presence of numerous
bones gnawed by hyænas in these caves, that the valleys
of the Clwyd and the Elwy were the favourite haunts
of that animal in the pleistocene age.</p>

<p>The earliest cavern explored in South Wales is that
of Crawley Rocks,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> Oxwich Bay, about twelve miles from
Swansea. It was discovered in quarrying the mountain
limestone in 1792, and contained the remains of the
elephant, rhinoceros, ox, stag, and hyæna. It was completely
destroyed before Dr. Buckland identified these
animals in the collection of Miss Talbot of Penrice Castle.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>The line of cliffs, bounding the rocky peninsula of
Gower, contains the cave of Paviland, described in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_VII">seventh</a> chapter (<a href="#Page_232">p.&nbsp;232</a>), as well as the group explored by
Colonel Wood of Start Hall, from the year 1848<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> to the
present time, Bacon Hole, Minchin Hole, Bosco’s Den,
Devil’s Hole, Crow Hole, Raven’s Cliff, Spritsail Tor, and
Long Hole, which are described by the late Dr. Falconer.
The <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros hemitœchus</i> was met with in comparative
abundance, and in association with the woolly rhinoceros,
mammoth, and <i class="taxonomy">E. antiquus</i>. In Bosco’s Den there
were no less than 750 shed antlers of reindeer; and in
Long Hole, many flint-flakes were discovered in 1860
underneath the stalagmite, and in association with the
extinct mammalia, which prove, as Dr. Falconer points
out, that man inhabited that district in the pleistocene
age.</p>

<p>These caves and fissures were at all levels in the cliff,
and in some the bottoms were covered with a stratum of
marine sand with sea shells, which showed that they
had been washed by the sea before they had been filled
by the ossiferous débris. Most of them had probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
been filled by streams in the same manner as Gailenreuth
and Wirksworth. They abound on the coast
merely because a clear section has been worn by the
waves. A straight cut through the rocks in any part of
the district would probably show them to occur in equal
abundance inland.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_129"><i>Caves in Pembrokeshire.</i></h3>

<p>The patches of limestone on the opposite side of Caermarthen

contain ossiferous caverns. The Rev. G.&nbsp;N. Smith,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> of
Gumfriston, has made a fine collection of bones and
teeth of mammoth and hyæna, from a fissure in the
Blackrock Quarry, close to Tenby, from a fissure in the
cliff on Caldy Island, and from the Coygan cave in an
outlier of limestone, near Pendine, and has discovered
flakes of flint and of a peculiar hornstone in the “tunnel
cave” termed the Hoyle, underneath stalagmite, in a
stratum containing bones of the bear and reindeer.
With the exception of the fissure in the Blackrock
Quarry none of these have been fully explored. On a
visit to Tenby, in 1872, I obtained many flint flakes, and
bones broken by man, from the breccia in the Hoyle;
and from a fissure on Caldy Island, numerous bones and
teeth of young wolves, which represented a whole litter,
and two metatarsals of bison, cemented together into a
compact mass.</p>

<p>The discovery of mammoth, rhinoceros, horse, Irish
elk, bison, wolf, lion, and bear, on so small an island as
Caldy, indicates that a considerable change has taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
place in the relation of the land to the sea in that district
since those animals were alive. It would have
been impossible for so many and so large animals to
have obtained food on so small an island. It may
therefore be reasonably concluded that, when they
perished in the fissures, Caldy was not an island, but
a precipitous hill, overlooking the broad valley now
covered by the waters of the Bristol Channel, but then
affording abundant pasture. The same inference may
also be drawn from the vast numbers of animals found
in the Gower caves, which could not have been supported
by the scant herbage of the limestone hills of that district.
We must, therefore, picture to ourselves a fertile
plain occupying the whole of the Bristol Channel, and
supporting herds of reindeer, horses, and bisons, many
elephants and rhinoceroses, and now and then being
traversed by a stray hippopotamus, which would
afford abundant prey to the lions, bears, and hyænas
inhabiting all the accessible caves, as well as to their
great enemy and destroyer man. We shall see in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_IX">ninth</a> chapter that the elevation of the whole district
above its present level is part of the general elevation
of north-western Europe, and no mere small or local
phenomenon.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_130"><i>Cave in Monmouthshire.</i></h3>

<p>King Arthur’s cave,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> on the side of a beautifully
wooded knoll, overlooking the valley of the Wye, near
Whitchurch, in Monmouthshire, explored by the Rev.
W.&nbsp;S. Symonds in 1871, is a hyæna den, like that of
Kirkdale, containing the gnawed remains of the lion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Irish elk, mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, and reindeer.
Flint flakes, however, occurred in the undisturbed strata,
which prove that it was also the resort of man. Mr.
Symonds believes that the sand and gravel inside were
deposited by the Wye, at a time when it flowed 300
feet above its present course, or before the valley was
cut down to that depth. If this conclusion be true, the
date of the occupation must be separated from the present
day by a vast interval, which is only to be measured
by the subsequent erosion of the valley by the slow
operation of the subaerial agents, running water, ice,
snow, and carbonic acid.</p>

<p>The only remains of the mammoth which I have
examined belong to young individuals, and consist of the
second and third milk-molars, a fact which I have very
generally observed in hyænas’ dens. The older mammoths
would not fall an easy prey to so cowardly an
animal. The cave had also been inhabited by man after
the pleistocene age, for coarse pottery of the neolithic
kind, and flint flakes, were dug out of an upper stratum,
while I was watching the excavation, in company with
the Rev. W.&nbsp;S. Symonds, and the “Wanderers” field club.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_131"><i>Caves of Gloucestershire and Somersetshire.</i></h3>

<p>The outliers of mountain limestone, on the southern
side of the Bristol Channel, have long been known for
their ossiferous caverns and fissures. From a fissure in
Durdham Down,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> near Bristol, Mr. J.&nbsp;S. Miller obtained
fragments of bones, about the year 1820, and among
them Dr. Buckland notices the fossil joint of the hind-leg
of a horse, the astragalus being held in natural position,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
between the tibia and the calcaneum, by stalagmite.
Subsequently a large series of animals of the same
species as those of Gower were discovered in it by Mr.
Stutchbury, and are preserved in the Bristol Museum.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_132"><i>Caves of the Mendip Hills.</i></h3>

<p>The caves of the Mendip Hills were known to contain
bones as early as the middle of the eighteenth century,
when that of Hutton,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> near Weston-super-Mare, was discovered
in working the ochre and calamine which fills
some of the fissures. The miners having opened an
ochre pit, south of the little village of Hutton, discovered
a fissure in the limestone full of good ochre, which they
followed to a depth of eight yards, until it led into a
cavern, the floor of which was formed of ochre, with large
quantities of white bones on the surface, and scattered
through its mass. Dr. Calcott describes the bones as
projecting from the sides, roof, and floor of the excavation
in such quantities as to resemble the contents of a
charnel-house. Subsequently it was fully explored by
the Rev. D. Williams, and Mr. Beard, of Banwell.</p>

<p>We owe the exploration of the neighbouring caves
of Banwell, Sandford Hill, Bleadon, Goat’s Hole, in
Burrington Combe, and Uphill,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> to the joint labours of
the two above-mentioned gentlemen, extending over
the period which elapsed between 1821 and 1860. The
vast quantity of remains which they obtained can only
be realized by a visit to the Museum of the Somerset
Archæological and Natural History Society, at Taunton.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span><a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
They belong to the same species as those already mentioned
from the caves of South Wales. The fauna of the
Mendip is, however, characterized by the great number
of lions, and by a few fragments of the glutton. Of the
former animal, Mr. Ayshford Sanford and myself have
met with sufficient remains to figure nearly every portion
of the skeleton, and the skulls prove that it was
not a tiger, as it is considered to be by some naturalists,
but a true lion, differing in no respect, except in its large
size, from those now living in Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>All these caverns consist of chambers at various levels
more or less connected with fissures, and, from the perfect
condition of the bones they must have been inaccessible
to the bone-destroying hyæna. Their contents
were introduced, as is suggested by Dr. Buckland, from
the surface by streams falling into swallow-holes (see
<a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a>), which have now, under the changed physical
conditions, ceased to flow.</p>

<p id="hdr_133">The extraordinary quantity of remains preserved in
one cave may be, to some extent, verified by a visit to
that at Banwell. It consists of two large chambers,
the upper one filled with thousands of bones of bison,
horse, and reindeer, taken out of the red silt which
originally filled it to the roof; the lower one full
of the undisturbed contents, from which the bones
project in the wildest confusion. This accumulation
has been introduced by water, through a vertical fissure
which opened on the surface. It is evident, from
the very nearly perfect skulls of wolf and bear which
were discovered, that the cave was not used as a den
by the hyænas. They are, however, proved to have
been living close by at the time, since their skulls, and
the gnawed antlers of reindeer, have been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
inside. They were probably swept in by the stream
along with the other bones.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_134"><i>The Uphill Cave.</i></h3>

<p>The Cave of Uphill,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> discovered in 1826, by some
workmen, and explored by the Rev. D. Williams, merits
especial notice, from the peculiar conditions under which
the remains of the extinct animals occurred. Like the
other caves of the Mendips, it consists of fissures opening
into chambers. In the upper part of one of these
fissures were the remains of rhinoceros, hyæna, bear,
horse, bison, and wild boar, imbedded in loam which
rested on two large masses of limestone that had fallen
so as to block up the fissure. Below this were no remains
of the extinct animals, and the fissure ultimately
led into a cave opening upon the line of cliffs. This
latter had been inhabited within historic times, since
many bones of sheep, or goat, and pieces of pottery,
were met with, as well as a coin of the Emperor Julian.
In this case, owing to the extraordinary accident of the
fissure being blocked up by a fall of stone, the pleistocene
accumulation is vertically above the historic; and
had the barrier given way, Mr. Williams would undoubtedly
have discovered the remains of the extinct
mammalia, lying in a heap above the comparatively
modern historic stratum. It seems to me very probable
that some such accident may have caused the occurrence
of the pleiocene machairodus in the Kent’s Hole cavern,
in association with the pleistocene mammalia. In the
long lapse of ages between the pleistocene and the present
day, such accidents would be likely to occur in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
few caverns, and we might expect to find remains of
widely different ages, in certain exceptional cases, lying
side by side, or even the older resting vertically over the
newer. At all events we must conclude, that superposition,
or association, cannot be rigidly enforced as
tests of relative age in all ossiferous caverns.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_135"><i>The Hyæna-den of Wookey Hole.</i></h3>

<p>The Hyæna-den of Wookey Hole,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> near Wells, on the
south side of the Mendips, which I explored with the
Rev. J. Williamson in 1859, and in the following years
with Messrs. Willett, Parker, and Ayshford Sanford, is
worthy of a more detailed notice, because it was among
the first caverns in this country in which works of art
were found under conditions that proved the co-existence
of man with the extinct mammalia.</p>

<p>The ravine in which it was discovered, in 1852, is one
of the many which pierce the dolomitic conglomerate,
or petrified sea-beach, of the Triassic age, resting at the
foot of the cliffs from which it was torn by the waves,
and overlying the lower slopes of the Mendips (see
<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). Open to the south, it runs almost horizontally
into the mountain-side, until closed abruptly northwards
by a perpendicular wall of rock, 200 feet or more in
height, ivy-covered, and affording a dwelling-place to
innumerable jackdaws. Out of a cave at its base, in
which Dr. Buckland discovered pottery and human teeth,
flows the river Axe, in a canal cut in the rock. In
cutting this passage, that the water might be conveyed
to a large paper-mill close by, the mouth of the hyæna-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>den
was intersected in 1852, and from that time up to
December 1859 it was undisturbed save by rabbits and
badgers, and even they did not penetrate far into the
interior, or make deep burrows. Close to the mouth of
the cave the workmen (employed in making this canal)
found more than 300 Roman coins, among which were
those of Allectus and of Commodus. When the Rev. J.
Williamson and myself began our exploration, about
twelve feet of the entrance of the cave had been cut
away, and large quantities of the earth, stones, and animal
remains had been used in the formation of an embankment
for the stream which runs past the present entrance of
the cave.</p>

<p>According to the testimony of the workmen, the bones
and teeth formed a layer about twelve inches in thickness,
which rested immediately upon the conglomerate-floor,
while they were comparatively scarce in the overlying
mass of stones and red earth. The workmen state
also that at the time of the discovery of the cave the hillside
presented no concavity to mark its presence. So completely
was the cave filled with débris up to the very roof,
that we were compelled to cut our way into it. Of the
stones scattered irregularly through the matrix of red
earth, some were angular, others water-worn; all are
derived from the decomposition of the dolomitic conglomerate
in which the cave is hollowed. Near the
entrance, and at a depth of five feet from the roof, were
three layers of peroxide of manganese, full of bony
splinters, and, passing obliquely up towards the southern
side of the cave and over a ledge of rock that rises
abruptly from the floor: further inwards they became
interblended one with another, and at a distance of
fifteen feet from the entrance were barely visible. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
and between these the animal remains were found in
the greatest abundance.</p>

  <p>Right lines = sections; dotted areas = bone-beds; shaded areas = ashes and implements.</p></div></div>

<p>While cutting our way inwards (<a href="#Fig_83">Figs. 83</a> and <a href="#Fig_88">88</a>), we
found an angular piece of flint, which had evidently been
chipped by human agency, and a water-worn fragment
of a belemnite, which probably had been derived from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
the neighbouring marlstone rocks. Bones and teeth of
the woolly rhinoceros, reindeer, stag, Irish elk, mammoth,
hyæna, cave-bear, lion, wolf, fox, and horse rewarded
our labours; and frogs’ remains, cemented together by
stalagmite, were abundant at the mouth. The teeth
preponderated greatly over the bones, and the great bulk
were those of the horse. The hyæna-teeth also were
very numerous, and in all stages of growth, from the
young unworn to the old tooth worn down to the very
gums. Those of the mammoth had belonged to a young
animal, and one had not been used at all. The hollow
bones were completely smashed and splintered, and
scored with tooth-marks, while the solid carpal, tarsal,
and sesamoid bones were uninjured, as in the Kirkdale
Cave. The organic remains were in all stages of decay,
some crumbling to dust at the touch, while others were
perfectly preserved and had lost very little of their
gelatine.</p>

<div id="Fig_84" class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 84, 85, 86, 87.</span>&mdash;Four Views of Flint Implements found in the Hyæna-den at Wookey Hole, near Wells.</div></div>

<p>In 1860 we resumed our excavations; and, in addition
to the above remains, found satisfactory evidence of
the former presence of man in the cave. Our search
was rewarded by one oval implement of white flint, of
rude workmanship (<a href="#Fig_84">Figs. 84, 85, 86, 87</a>), one chert
arrow-head, a roughly-chipped and a round flattened
piece of chert, together with various splinters of flint,
which had apparently been knocked off in the manufacture
of some implement. Two rudely-fashioned bone
arrow-heads were also found, which unfortunately were
subsequently lost by the photographer to whom they
were sent; they resembled in shape an equilateral
triangle with the angles at the base bevelled off. All
were found in and around the same spot, in contact
with some hyæna-teeth, between the dark bands of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
manganese, at a depth of four feet from the roof, and
at a distance of twelve feet from the present entrance
(<a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>, <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>That there might be no mistake about the accuracy
of the observations, I examined every shovelful of débris
as it was thrown out by the workman; while the
exact spot where they were excavating was watched by
my colleague. The figured implement was picked out
of the undisturbed matrix by him; the rest were found
by me in the earth thrown out from the same place.</p>

<p>The lines of peroxide of manganese must have been
accumulated on the old floors of the cave, because they
were associated with numerous splinters and gnawed
animal remains; and there can be no doubt that the latter
were introduced by the hyænas. Those animals have
a peculiar habit, as Dr. Buckland proved by experiment,
of gnawing similar bones in precisely the same way;
and a comparison of the relics of the meals of the hyænas
in the Zoological Gardens with those in the cave, shows
that the latter have passed between the jaws of a like
animal that once inhabited Somersetshire. Coprolites of
the same animal were very abundant, and in some places
formed a greyish-white layer of phosphate of lime.
There were also other equally unmistakeable traces of
the animal in fragments of bone, polished by their
tread, as in the Kirkdale cave. It is, therefore, only
reasonable to suppose that these remains of animals were
brought into the cave from time to time by hyænas,
and left on the floors. That they were not introduced
by water is proved by the preservation of the delicate
processes and points of bone, which would certainly have
been broken <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in transitu</i>. Since, then, the implements,
which, beyond doubt, had been fashioned by man, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
underneath one of these old floors, it was certain that
man was contemporary in the district with the hyæna
and the animals on which it preyed, and the fact that
they were found only on one spot implies that they
were deposited by the hand of man. To suppose that
a savage would take the trouble to excavate a trench
twenty-four feet long&mdash;for twelve feet of the former
mouth of the cave had been cut away&mdash;with miserable
implements, and consequently with great labour, and
having excavated it again to fill it up to the very roof,
is little less than absurd. Nor could such an operation
take place in such a deposit, without the stratification of
the layers being destroyed. The absence of pottery and
human bones precludes the idea of the cave ever having
been a place of sepulture, such as Aurignac or Bruniquel.
This discovery, therefore, of itself stamps the contemporaneity
of man with the extinct mammalia, and following
close on the similar discoveries in Brixham cave, to be
mentioned presently, puts the question beyond all doubt.</p>

<p>In April 1861 we resumed our excavations; and, as
we made our way inwards, found that the cave began to
narrow, and ultimately to bifurcate, one branch extending
vertically upwards, while the other appeared to
extend almost horizontally to the right hand. As we
reached the middle constricted passage, the teeth became
fewer, while the stones were of larger size than any that
we had hitherto discovered. The great majority of the
gnawed antlers of deer were found at this part, also the
posterior half of a cervine skull, the right upper jaw of
wolf, and, what is more remarkable, a stone with one of
its surfaces coated with a deposit apparently of stalagmite:
this, however, was much lighter than stalagmite,
and not so good a conductor of heat; and, on analysis,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
I found that it consisted of phosphate of lime, with a
little carbonate, and a very small portion of peroxide of
manganese. Doubtless the surface of the stone, covered
with phosphate of lime, formed part of the ancient floor
of the cave, and hence was coated with <i class="anatomy">album græcum</i>;
while the lower part, being imbedded in the earth on the
floor, was not so coated. This deposit may, perhaps,
explain the absence of round balls of coprolite, which,
assuming that the cave at the time was more damp than
that at Kirkdale, would be trodden down on the floor
by the hyænas, instead of presenting a rounded form.
The stone also itself exhibits tooth-marks underneath
the coating of <i class="anatomy">album græcum</i>, and probably was gnawed
by the hyænas, like the antlers, for amusement. This
discovery proves that violent watery action had but
small share, if any, in filling the cave; for in that case
the soft covering would have been removed from the
stone. Similar evidence is offered by the wonderful
preservation of some of the more delicate fragments of
bone, such as the palatine process of the maxilla of the
wolf.</p>

<p>The section made in cutting this passage presented
irregular layers of peroxide of manganese, full of bony
splinters, and each more or less covered by a layer of
bones in various stages of decay. These layers were
absent from the upper portion of the passage. There
were masses of prisms of calc-spar scattered confusedly
through the matrix. After excavating the vertical
branch as far as we dared (for the large stones in it
made the task dangerous), we were compelled to leave
off, having penetrated altogether only thirty-four feet
from the entrance. No flint implements rewarded our
search this year. Teeth were far more numerous than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
bones, probably because they are more durable as well
as because of their rejection by the hyænas. One jaw
was bitten in two, and the fragments found about a foot
apart in the undisturbed matrix, just as they had been
dropped from the mouth of the hyæna.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1862 Mr. Parker, Mr. Willett, and
myself resolved to verify the association of articles of
man’s handiwork along with the extinct mammalia, by
cleaning out the cave, which was courteously placed at
our disposal by the owner, Mr. Hodgekinson.</p>

<p>Our first task was to clear the contents out of the
portion of the cave nearest the mouth, or the antrum
(<a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>), and as we excavated onwards many traces
of the presence of man were met with. A wide area on
the left-hand side (<i>b</i>), where the roof and floor of the
cave gradually met together, furnished innumerable fragments
of charcoal, and many flint implements associated
with the remains of the horse, rhinoceros, and hyæna.
One fragment of bone in particular, belonging to the
rhinoceros, had been calcined, and its carbonized condition
bore unmistakeable testimony that it had been
burnt while the animal juices were present. There were
many other bones also burnt, which indicated the place
where fires had been kindled, and food cooked. As we
dug our way forward we met with a third area (<i>c</i>), that
furnished flint and chert implements under the same conditions
of deposit as that which tempted us to carry on
our excavations. Its relation to the old floors of hyæna-occupation
is shown by the dark lines over the area <i>c</i>
in <a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>. At last the large open chamber (<span class="smcap smaller">A</span>) was
cleared; it measured about thirty feet wide by six feet
high, and it extended forty feet inwards. On the left
there was a small upward-turning passage, very nearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
blocked up with a mass of stalagmite; at the farther
end a vertical fissure extended upwards (<span class="smcap smaller">F</span>), to the surface.
This fissure has subsequently been proved to extend
downwards to the right, and will doubtless furnish
large quantities of animal remains to future explorers.</p>

<p>The large chamber now turned abruptly to the left,
and we gradually worked our way into a small horizontal
passage about four feet high. Here there was an
interval of from three to four inches between the roof
and contents, traversed by stalactites, which in some
places formed a smooth undulating drapery with stony
tassels, and in others tiny pillars extending down to the
débris, and, as it were, propping up the roof. These
pedestals (see <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>) gradually expanded into round
plates of stalagmite, which sometimes met and formed a
continuous crust. In some places an infiltration of carbonate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
of lime had cemented organic remains, stones,
and earth into a hard mass, which had to be broken up
with gunpowder before it could be removed out of the
cave. The excitement of extracting from these blocks
their treasures was of the very keenest, for we could not
tell what a stroke of the hammer would reveal. Sometimes
an elephant’s tooth suddenly came to light, at
others a hyæna’s jaw, or a rhinoceros’ tooth, or the
antler of a reindeer, or the canine of a bear. The bones
were so numerous that they scarcely attracted attention.
In one fragment of this breccia, now in the Brighton
Museum, are a tusk and carpal of mammoth, the right
ulna of the woolly rhinoceros, and an antler of reindeer.
In a second, two shoulder-blades and two haunch bones
of the woolly rhinoceros, with a coprolite and lower jaw
of cave hyæna. As the men removed the large blocks
they were brought to the mouth of the cave to be
broken up by our smaller instruments. Presently the
passage narrowed to about six feet, and presented the
following section (<a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>). On the floor of the cave
there was a layer of red earth two feet in thickness,
and, as usual, containing a few organic remains and
many stones (<a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>, 1). Upon this rested a most
remarkable accumulation of bones, and teeth, matted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
and compacted together, from three to four inches thick,
and extending horizontally from one side of the passage
to the other (<a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>, 2). Next came a layer of dark
red earth (<a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>, 3), loose and friable, three to four
inches thick, supporting in its surface a few rounded
stalagmites, and a few stalactitic pillars, that spanned
the interval of from three to four inches between it and
the roof. This bone-bed was about seven feet wide and
fourteen feet long, affording, therefore, a square area of
ninety-eight feet (see dotted area <span class="smcap smaller">B</span> <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>, and in <a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a>). The enormous quantity of the remains of animals
present cannot fairly be estimated even by the large
number preserved, because most of the bones were as
soft as wet mortar. The five hundred and fifty specimens
obtained must be looked upon merely as a small
fraction of the whole.</p>

  Dotted area = bone-bed.</div></div>

<p>We presently passed beyond the bone-bed, and found
that the passage bifurcated (<a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">C</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">D</span>), the
smaller branch going straight forwards and gently upwards
(<a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a>), while the larger stretched at right
angles from it and passed gently downwards. In the
former there was a second bone-bed similar in every
respect to that already described, which continued
undiminished in thickness until it rested directly on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
the floor. It afforded a square area of about fifteen
feet. The passage was about sixteen inches high and
three feet wide, and gradually narrowed until at a
distance of twelve feet from the bifurcation a stalactite
six inches long reached the floor and formed a vertical
bar, as if to forbid another ingress. When this had
been explored as far as we could crawl, the larger branch
(<a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">D</span>, and <a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a>) engaged our attention, and we
soon discovered a third layer of bones of the same character
as the others, and in the same position, excepting
that in some places it was in immediate contact with
the roof. In width it was six, in length fourteen, and
in square area eighty-four feet. From its further end to
the termination of the passage there was not the slightest
vestige of bones or teeth, and a stiff grey clay rested on
a horizontal layer of sand on the floor. Here the passage
suddenly turned upwards until it became so small
and barren that it was not worth our while to pursue it
farther. It doubtless rises to the surface, like the large
fissure opposite the entrance of the cave shown in <a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>The exploration was resumed the following year by
Mr. Ayshford Sanford and myself, and yielded vast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
quantities of fossil remains. We cleared out the space
marked 1863 in the plan, and discovered a flint implement
at the point marked <i>d</i>, in <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>. My friend the
late Mr. Wickham Flower has also worked the cave,
more particularly at the right-hand side of the entrance
chamber.</p>

<p>The ashes and implements were found in positions,
near the mouth of the cave, where man himself may
have placed them (see <a href="#Fig_83">Figs. 83</a>, <a href="#Fig_88">88</a>), with the exception
of the flint implement at <i>d</i>, and an ash of bone imbedded
in the earthy matrix between the canine tooth
and a coprolite of the hyæna, and cemented to a
fragment of dolomitic conglomerate. This was found
far in the cave, either at the entrance of the passage
<span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, or in the middle of the passage <span class="smcap smaller">D</span>. The latter
passage yielded the only rolled flint without traces of
man’s handiwork. The materials out of which the implements
were made were used pretty equally. All
those, like <a href="#Fig_84">Fig. 84</a>, were of flint; all those chipped into
a rounded form and flat-oval in section of chert from
the Upper Greensand; while the flakes consisted of
both used indifferently. Besides these three typical
forms, which were most abundant, is a fourth, in form
roughly pyramidal, with a smooth and flat base, and a
cutting edge all round. Of these we found but two
examples, both consisting of chert. In form they are
exactly similar to several hundreds found in a British
village at Stanlake, in Berkshire, and to those I discovered
in a cemetery of the same age at Yarnton, near
Oxford. They strongly resemble a cast I have of one
found by M. Lartet in the cave of Aurignac. Were it
not for this similarity, I should look upon them as
cores from which flakes had been struck. The rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
are mere splinters, irregular in form, and probably
made in the manufacture of the various flint and chert
implements. All the flint implements have been altered
in colour and structure, either by heat or, as is
more probable, by some chemical action. Without exception,
the old surfaces present a waxy lustre (by the
absence of which forgeries are easily detected), the colour
is of a uniform milk-white, and the ordinary conchoidal
fracture is replaced by that of porcelain. Some are not
harder than chalk. I have met with weathered and calcined
flints in Sussex in which similar changes are
observable, and in which the difference in the results of
chemical action and heat can hardly be detected. The
chert implements, on the other hand, show no traces of
any such changes, but are similar in colour and structure
to the rocks from which they came&mdash;the Upper Greensand
of the Blackdown Hills.</p>

<p>All the fragments of calcined bone, with the exception
of one already mentioned, were found near the entrance
(see <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>, <i>b</i>), and in a place more suitable for a fire than
any other in the cave. I can identify none of them as
human. The coarse texture, the structure, and the
thickness of one indicate a fragment of a long bone of the
rhinoceros.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> All resemble many splinters strewn about
in other parts of the cave, which are not calcined, but
were evidently introduced by the hyænas. The calcination
may therefore be due to the accident of their lying
upon the surface at the time the fire was kindled.</p>

<p>The remains obtained in 1862&ndash;3 from three to four
thousand in number, afford a vivid picture of the animal
life of the time in Somerset. They belong to the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>

<p>The remains of these animals were so intermingled
that they must have been living together at the same
time. They lie large with small, the more with the less
dense, and are not in the least degree sorted by water.
There is no evidence of the hyæna succeeding to the
cave-bear, or the reindeer to the urus, or that the bears
came here to die, as in some of the German caves, or
that the herbivores fell, or were swept into open fissures,
and left their remains, as in the caves of Hutton and
Plymouth. On the contrary, the numerous jaws and
teeth of hyæna, and the marks of those teeth upon nearly
every one of the specimens, show that they alone introduced
the remains that were found in such abundance.
And they preyed not merely upon horses, uri,
and other herbivores, but upon one another (<a href="#Fig_92">Figs. 92</a>, <a href="#Fig_93">93</a>), and they even overcame the cave-bear and
lion in their full prime. Some of the bones of the
larger animals, and in particular a leg-bone of a
gigantic urus, have been broken short across and not
bitten through&mdash;a circumstance which points towards
one of the causes of the vast accumulation of bones in so
small a cave. It is well known that wolves and hyænas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
at the present day are in the habit of hunting in packs,
and of forcing their prey over precipices. The Wookey
ravine is admirably situated for this mode of hunting,
and would not fail to destroy any animal forced into it
from the hill-side. It is therefore very probable that
the hyænas sometimes caught their prey in this manner.
They would not have dared to attack the bears and lions
unless these had been disabled.</p>

<div id="Fig_91" class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
  <img src="images/i_311.jpg" width="385" height="134" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>&mdash;Longitudinal Section through <span class="smcap smaller">D</span> of <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>.<br />
  Dotted area = bone-bed.</div></div>

<p>But if all the remains of the animals were introduced
by the hyænas, they certainly in some cases do not
occupy the exact position in which they were left by
those animals. One of the bone layers (<a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a>)
for instance, actually touched the roof. This, indeed,
has been used as an argument in favour of their having
been introduced by water, from some unknown repository.
But if this hypothesis be admitted, we are landed
in the following dilemma: either the introducing current
of water must have passed down the vertical passages,
or upwards through the horizontal mouth of the
cave. In the former case the three bone layers would
not have been found in the narrow passages, but would
have been swept out into the wide chamber, where the
force of the hypothetical current must have abated. In
the latter case the great bulk of the remains would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
been found in the chamber, and not in the smaller passages.
Moreover, the absence of marks of transport by
water, and especially of that sorting action which water
as a conveying agent always manifests, renders the view
of their being so introduced untenable. On the other
hand, the horizontality of the layers of bone, and the
presence of sand and of red earth, imply that water was
an agent in re-arranging the bones and in introducing
some of the contents of the cave. The only solution of
the difficulty that I can hazard is the occurrence of floods
from time to time, during the occupation of the hyænas,
similar to those which now take place in the caverns of the
neighbourhood. A few years ago, the outlet of the Axe
in the great cave was partially blocked up, and the water
rose to a height of upwards of sixteen feet, leaving a
horizontal deposit of red earth of the same nature as that
in the hyæna-den. Now if we suppose that similar floods
were caused by an obstruction in the ravine below the
hyæna-den, it may have been flooded, just as the upper
galleries of the great cave, and the water laden with
sediment might have elevated the layers of matted bone,
and some of the scattered remains on the surface, while
the current was insufficient to disturb the stones, or to
affect to any extent the deposits of former floods. The
buoyancy of the organic remains is not required to be
greater, on this hypothesis, than in that of their having
been introduced by a current through the vertical passages.
Some of the wet bones taken straight from the
cave were sufficiently light to be carried down by the
current of the Axe.</p>

<p>All these facts taken together enable us to form a clear
idea of the condition of things at the time the hyæna-den
was inhabited. The hyænas were the normal occupants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
of the cave, and thither they brought their prey.
We can realize those animals pursuing elephants and
rhinoceroses along the slopes of the Mendip, till they
scared them into the precipitous ravine, or watching until
the strength of a disabled bear or lion ebbed away sufficiently
to allow of its being overcome by their cowardly
strength. Man appeared from time to time on the scene,
a miserable savage armed with bow and spear, unacquainted
with metals, but defended from the cold by coats
of skin.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> Sometimes he took possession of the den and
drove out the hyænas; for it is impossible for both to
have lived in the same cave at the same time. He
kindled his fires at the entrance, to cook his food, and
to keep away the wild animals; then he went away,
and the hyænas came to their old abode. While all
this was taking place there were floods from time to time
until eventually the cave was completely blocked up
with their deposits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
The winter cold at the time must have been very
severe to admit of the presence of the reindeer and
lemming.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_136"><i>The district of the Mendip Hills at a higher level than now.</i></h3>

<p>When we reflect on the vast quantities of the remains
of the animals buried in the caves of so limited an area
as the Mendip Hills, it is evident that there must have
been abundance of food to have enabled them to live
in the district. The great marsh now extending from
Wells to the sea, and cutting off the Mendips from the
fertile region to the south, was probably a rich valley at a
higher level than at present, joining the westward plains
now submerged under the Bristol Channel. An elevation
of from 100 to 300 feet would produce the physical
conditions necessary for the sustenance of the herbivora
found in the caves both in South Wales and Somersetshire.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_137"><i>The characters of a Hyæna-den.</i></h3>

<div id="Fig_93" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap smaller">A</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, upper and lower jaws of Hyæna-whelp, Wookey.</div></div>

<p>The remains of the animals which have been eaten by
the cave-hyæna, may be recognized by the following
characters. All are more or less scored by teeth, and
the only perfect bones are those which are solid, or of
very dense texture. The skulls are represented merely
by the harder portions. That of the woolly rhinoceros,
for example, by the hard pedestal which supports the
anterior horn (see <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>). Several of these pedestals
occurred in the Wookey hyæna-den. The lower jaws
also have lost their angle and coronoid process, and are
gnawed to the pattern of the shaded portion of <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>,
the less succulent part bearing the teeth being rejected.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
This holds good of the jaws of all the animals so persistently,
that out of more than two hundred from
Wookey there was only one exception. The jaw of the
glutton (<a href="#Fig_82">Fig. 82</a>), from Plas
Heaton, is also gnawed to
the same shape, and one of
those of the cave-bear from
the cavern of Lherm, considered
by M. Garrigou to
have been fashioned by the
hand of man into an implement,
seems to me, after a
careful comparison in company
with Dr. Falconer, referable
solely to the gnawing
of the hyæna. In <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>, the lower jaw of an
adult hyæna is represented,
and in <a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a> (1) the upper
and lower jaws of a hyæna-whelp.
In the latter the
teeth marks <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are remarkably
distinct.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span>&mdash;Left Thigh-bone of Woolly Rhinoceros gnawed by Hyænas; Shaded parts left. (Wookey Hole.)</div></div>

<p>The marrow-containing
bones are also universally
splintered away, until either
the articular ends alone are left, as in <a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a>, or in
some cases, as in that of the femur of woolly rhinoceros
(<a href="#Fig_94">Fig. 94</a>), the dense central portion bearing the
third trochanter is preserved. This fragment is extremely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
abundant in nearly all the hyæna-caves in
this country. From the invariable habit of the hyæna
leaving the bones of its prey in fragments of this
kind, their dens are characterized by the absence of
perfect long-bones and skulls, and consequently, when
these occur in a cave it is certain proof that it was not
occupied by these animals. In a great many caves,
however, the gnawed fragments are associated with the
perfect bones, as, for example, at Banwell, a circumstance
that may be accounted for by the untouched carcases
and the gnawed fragments being swept in from the
surface by a stream falling into a swallow-hole. In all
hyæna-dens also are large quantities of <i class="anatomy">album græcum</i>,
as well as fragments of bone more or less polished by
the friction of the hyæna’s feet.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_138"><i>The Caves of Devonshire.</i></h3>

<p>The ossiferous caves on the south coast of Devonshire,
explored during the last fifty years, are by far the most
important in this country, since they were the first which
were scientifically examined, and the first which established
the co-existence of man with the extinct mammalia.</p>

<p>We owe the full details of their history to the labours
of the distinguished cave-hunter Mr. Pengelly, F.R.S.,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>
whose writings are freely used in the following account.</p>

<h3><i>The Oreston Caves.</i></h3>

<p>The first intimation of the presence of fossil bones in
the district was furnished by Mr. Whidbey, the engineer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
in charge of the construction of the Plymouth breakwater,
who discovered numerous bones and teeth, imbedded
in clayey loam, in some cavernous fissures at Oreston,
which were brought before the Royal Society by Sir
Everard Home in 1817. Thus Dr. Buckland’s researches
in Kirkdale were anticipated by four years. From time
to time, since that date, several other fissures and
caves close by have furnished remains of rhinoceros,
mammoth, hyæna, lion, and other animals. Among the
bones and teeth originally sent up by Mr. Whidbey are
several which were identified by Prof. Busk,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> as belonging
to the <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros megarhinus</i>, a species that is
vastly abundant in the pleiocene strata of northern Italy
and is also represented in the early pleistocene forest-bed
of Norfolk and Suffolk, and in the lower brickearths of
the valley of the Thames at Grays and Crayford. This
is the only case on record of the discovery of the animal
in a cavern deposit.</p>

<p>The cavernous fissures in the neighbourhood of Yealmpton,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
about seven miles east-south-east from Plymouth,
explored by Mr. Bellamy and Colonel Mudge, R.A., F.R.S.
in 1835&ndash;6, contained the remains of the hyæna and
rhinoceros, and the other animals more usually associated
with them. They were probably filled, as in the case
of Oreston, mainly by the streams which introduced the
pebbles. They may, however, from time to time have
been inhabited by the hyænas, although the presence of
three skulls of that animal forbids the supposition that
they dragged in all the fossil bones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_139"><i>The Caves at Brixham.</i></h3>

<p>The series of fissures accidentally discovered in 1858,
in quarrying the rock which overlooks the little fishing
town of Brixham, known as the Windmill cave, was
selected by the late Dr. Falconer,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> as a spot in which
thorough investigation would be likely to decide the then
doubtful question of the co-existence of man with the
extinct mammalia. Kent’s Hole had been disturbed by
repeated diggings, and the results might be viewed with
suspicion. He, therefore, urged the importance of a
systematic examination of this virgin cave with such
effect, that it was undertaken by the Royal and Geological
Societies, and a committee was appointed, comprising,
amongst others, Dr. Falconer, Prof. Ramsay, Mr.
Prestwich, Sir Charles Lyell, Prof. Owen, Mr. Godwin-Austen,
and Mr. Pengelly. To the superintendence of
the last is mainly due the minute care with which the
exploration was conducted. The remains have been
identified by Dr. Falconer and Prof. Busk. The work
was commenced in July 1858, and completed in the
summer of 1859.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>The cave consists of three principal galleries, with
diverging passages, running in the direction of the joints
from north to south, and from east to west, communicating
with the surface at four points. The following is
the general section (<a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>) of the deposits in descending
order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
(A.) On the floor was a layer of stalagmite, varying
from a few inches to upwards of a foot in thickness,
and containing only twenty-five bones, among which
were the humerus of a bear, and the antler of a reindeer.</p>

<div id="Fig_95" class="figleft" style="width: 269px;">
  <img src="images/i_320.jpg" width="269" height="464" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span>&mdash;Diagram of Deposits in Brixham Cave. (Pengelly.)</div></div>

<p>(B.) Reddish cave-earth with fragments and blocks
of limestone, and of stalagmite, generally averaging from
two to four feet. In it
1,102 bones were discovered
irregularly scattered
through its mass, and
belonging to mammoth,
woolly rhinoceros, lion,
cave, grizzly, and brown
bears, reindeer, and others.
They varied in state of
preservation, and some
were scored and marked
by teeth. Associated with
these, thirty-six rude flint
implements were met with,
of indisputable human
workmanship, and of the
same general order as
those figured by the Rev.
J. MacEnery from Kent’s
Hole. Among them was
one lanceolate implement
with rounded point and unworked butt end, considered
by Mr. John Evans, F.R.S., of the type of those usually
found in the valley gravels.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> There was, therefore, the
most conclusive evidence that man inhabited the neighbourhood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
either before or during the time of the accumulation
of <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, and before those physical changes took
place by which the red silt ceased to be deposited, or
the stalagmite above began to be formed.</p>

<p>(C.) At the bottom of the cave-earth was a deposit of
gravel, principally of rounded pebbles and devoid of
fossils.</p>

<p>The early history of the cave, as shown by these deposits,
is given by Mr. Prestwich, in the report presented
to the Royal Society, as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Looking at all the phenomena of Brixham cave,
the conclusion your reporter has arrived at is, that the
formation of the cave commenced and was carried on
simultaneously with the excavation of the valley; that
the small streams flowing down the upper tributary
branches of the valley entered the western openings of
the cave and, traversing the fissures in the limestone,
escaped by lower openings in the chief valley, just as
the Grotto d’Arcy was formed by an overflow from the
cave taking a short cut through the limestone hills,
round which the river winds. These tributary streams
brought in the shingle bed (<a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>), which fills the
bottom of the fissure. It was only during occasional
droughts, when the streams were dry, that the cave seems
to have been frequented by animals, their remains being
very scarce in that bed, while indications of man are comparatively
numerous. As the excavation of the valley
proceeded, the level of the stream was lowered and became
more restricted to the valley-channel. The cave
consequently became drier, and was more resorted to by
predatory animals, who carried in their prey to devour,
and was less frequented by man. At the same time with
the periodical floods, which there is every reason to believe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
from other investigations, were so great during the quaternary
period, the cave would long continue to be subject
to inundations, the muddy waters of which deposited
the silt forming the cave-earth, burying progressively the
bones left from season to season by succeeding generations
of beasts of prey. By the repetition at distant
intervals of these inundations, and by the accumulation
during the intervening periods of fresh crops of bones,
the bone-bearing cave-earth, B, was gradually formed.
During this time the occasional visits of man are indicated
by the rare occurrence of a flint implement, lost,
probably, as he groped his way through the dark passages
of the cave. As the valley became deeper, and as
with the change of climate at the close of the (pleistocene)
quaternary period the floods became less, so did
the cave become drier and more resorted to by animals.
At last it seems to have become a place for permanent
resort for bears; their remains in all stages of growth,
including even sucking cubs, were met with in the upper
part of the cave-earth, in greater numbers than were the
bones of any other animals. These animals resorted
especially to the darker and more secluded flint-knife
gallery, where 221 out of 366 of their determinable bones
were found, whereas only twenty-six were met with in
the reindeer gallery.</p>

<p>“Finally, as the cave became out of the reach of the
flood waters, the drippings from the roof, which up to
this period had, with the single exception before mentioned,
been lost in the accumulating cave-earth, or deposited
in thin calcareous incrustations on the exposed
bones, now commenced that deposit of stalagmite which
sealed up and preserved undisturbed the shingle and
cave-earth deposited under former and different conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
The cave, however, still continued to be the
occasional resort of beasts of prey; for sparse remains of
the reindeer, together with those of the bear and rhinoceros,
were found in the stalagmite floor. After a time
the falling in of the roof at places (and any earthquake
movement may have detached blocks from it), and the
external surface weathering, stopped up some parts of the
cave, and closed its entrances with an accumulation of
débris. From that time it ceased to be accessible, except
to the smaller rodents and burrowing animals, and
so remained unused and untrodden until its recent discovery
and exploration.”<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>Mr. Pengelly points out<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> an episode in the history of
the cave, between the formation and the filling up with
its present contents, which is of considerable importance,
viewed in relation to the deposits in Kent’s Hole. Over
the empty space in <span class="smcap smaller">D</span>, of <a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>, is an ancient stalagmite
floor, <span class="smcap smaller">E</span>, constituting the present ceiling, and shutting off
D from the true roof above, <span class="smcap smaller">E</span>. At the time this was
formed, the cave must have been filled up to that level
with débris, fragments of which are set in the inferior
portion of the calcareous sheet. Subsequently, and before
the present contents, <span class="smcap smaller">A</span> and <span class="smcap smaller">B</span>, were introduced, the
whole of this material has been swept away, probably
by an unusual flood similar to that alluded
to in the <a href="#CHAPTER_II">second</a> chapter in the Clapham cave. The
pieces of stalagmite in the cave-earth are, probably,
some of the relics of the older floor. This filling up,
re-excavating, and re-filling with its present contents,
are phenomena which considerably complicate the problems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
offered not merely by Brixham cave, but also by
those of Kent’s Hole.</p>

<p>Two other caverns in the neighbourhood of Brixham,
the “Ash Hole” and “Bench,” have also yielded the
remains of the reindeer, hyæna, and several other
pleistocene species, and are fully described by Mr.
Pengelly, in his essays contributed to the Devonshire
Association.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_140"><i>Kent’s Hole.</i></h3>

<p>The celebrated cave of Kent’s Hole,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> known from time
immemorial, was first found to contain fossil bones by
Mr. Northmore, and Sir W.&nbsp;C. Trevelyan in 1824, and
was subsequently explored by the Rev. J. MacEnery
in the five following years, during which he met with
flint implements in association with the extinct animals
in the undisturbed strata, and obtained the teeth of
the sabre-toothed feline, named by Prof. Owen <i class="taxonomy">Machairodus
latidens</i>, which has never before or since been
discovered in any other cavern in Britain. His manuscripts
unfortunately were not used until they passed
into the hands of Mr. Vivian, of Torquay, who published
an abstract in 1859. Subsequently they were published
in full by Mr. Pengelly, in 1869. The discovery of the
flint implements, verified by Mr. Godwin Austen in
1840, and six years later also by a committee of the
Torquay Natural History Society, was received with incredulity
by the scientific world, until the result of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
exploration of the Brixham cave had placed the fact of
the co-existence of man with the extinct mammalia
beyond all doubt. In 1864 a committee<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> was appointed
by the British Association for the carrying on the investigation,
which from that time to the present has been
conducted under the careful supervision of Mr. Pengelly.</p>

<p>The cave consists of two parallel series of chambers
and galleries, an eastern and a western, which penetrate
the low cliff of Devonian limestone in the direction of
the joints, with a northern and southern entrance, very
nearly at the same level, “about fifty feet apart, from
180 to 190 feet above the level of mean tide, and about
seventy feet above the bottom of the valley immediately
adjacent.” The largest chamber of the eastern series is
sixty-two feet from east to west, and fifty-three from
north to south. The extent of the cave has not yet been
ascertained.</p>

<p>The contents, examined with the minutest care (on
Mr. Pengelly’s method, see <a href="#APPENDIX_I">Appendix I</a>.), were found to
be arranged in the following order.</p>

<p>(A.) The surface was composed of dark earth varying
in thickness from a few inches to a foot, on which rested
large blocks of limestone, fallen from the roof. It contained
mediæval remains, Roman pottery, and combs
fashioned out of bone, similar to those discovered in the
Victoria and Dowkerbottom caves in Yorkshire, which
prove that the cave was frequented during the historic
period. A barbed iron spear-head, a bronze spear-head,
other bronze articles, and polished stone celts, establish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
the fact that it was also used during the iron, bronze,
and neolithic ages. This stratum contained the broken
bones of the short-horn (<i class="taxonomy">Bos longifrons</i>), goat, and
horse, large quantities of charcoal, and was to a great
extent a refuse-heap like that in the Victoria cave.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span>&mdash;Oval Implement from Kent’s Hole (1/1) (Evans.)</div></div>

<p>(B.) Below this was a stalagmite floor, varying in
thickness from one to three feet, covering</p>

<p>(C.) The red earth, with stones, bones of the extinct
animals, and flint implements, associated together
in the greatest confusion, as well as large lumps of
stalagmite and of breccia, which had been torn out of a
pre-existent floor. In the “vestibule,” near one of the
entrances, a black layer beneath the stalagmite, composed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
to a great extent, of charcoal, indicated the
position of the fire-places, and contained a vast number
of rude unpolished palæolithic implements. There were
also local stalagmitic bands. The flint implements were
met with at various depths, and consist of three distinct
types: the lanceolate, <a href="#Fig_96">Fig. 96</a>, the oval, with edge carefully
chipped for cutting, <a href="#Fig_97">Fig. 97</a>, and the flake (see
<a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>). Besides these a few implements have been
discovered of the same shape as those found in the gravel
beds; in outline and section roughly triangular, and
tapering to a point from a blunt base, which was probably
intended to be held in the hand.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> Several articles
of bone and antler were also met with, comprising an
awl, or piercer, a needle with the eye large enough to
admit small packthread, and three harpoon-heads, one of
which is barbed on both sides (<a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>), the others being
merely barbed on one side (<a href="#Fig_99">Fig. 99</a>). A rounded pebble
of coarse red sandstone, battered into a cheese-like form,
by being used as a hammer (<a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a>), was also found.
All these articles bring the palæolithic inhabitants of
Kent’s Hole into relation with those of the caves and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
rock-shelters of the south of France, to be described in
the next chapter.</p>

<p>(D.) The cave-earth rested on a compact, dark red
breccia composed of angular fragments of limestone and
pebbles of sandstone embedded in a sandy calcareous
paste, identical in constitution with the fragments of the
older breccia discovered in the cave-earth. It has furnished
bones of bears, and four flint implements. The
cave-earth, <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>, and the breccia, <span class="smcap smaller">E</span>, seem to stand to one
another in an inverse ratio as regards thickness: where
the former was thin, the latter was sometimes as much
as twelve feet thick. From this relation, as well as from
the imbedded fragments of the latter, it may be concluded
that the former is the more modern, and that in
the interval between their accumulation the latter had
been, to a considerable extent, broken up.</p>

<div id="Fig_100" class="figcenter" style="width: 245px;">
  <img src="images/i_328.jpg" width="245" height="173" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span>&mdash;Hammer-stone (1/2). (Evans.)</div></div>

<p>There is very good reason for the belief, that before
any of the present cave-earth was introduced, Kent’s
Hole had been filled nearly to the roof by an older
cave accumulation, now represented by the undisturbed
breccia and the included fragments. In a portion
of the cave termed the “gallery,” there is a sheet of
stalagmite, extending overhead from wall to wall, and
constituting a ceiling that reaches from wall to wall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
without further support than that offered by its own
cohesion. Above it, in the limestone rock, there is a
considerable alcove. This branch of the cavern, therefore,
is divided into three stories or flats, that below the
floor occupied with cave-earth, that between the floor
and the ceiling entirely unoccupied, and that above the
ceiling also without a deposit of any kind. For such a
sheet of stalagmite to have been formed it is absolutely
necessary for the cave to have been filled up to its level
with materials of some kind, just as it is necessary for
the formation of a film of ice that it should be crystallized
from the surface of water. We may, therefore, infer
that Kent’s Hole, like Brixham, was originally filled up
to the level of the ceiling (see <a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>, <span class="smcap smaller">E</span>), then that the
contents were swept out, with the exception of the
breccia, and lastly, that the present cave-earth was
introduced. The occurrence of the remains of bear, and
of flint implements, in this breccia also proves that man
and bears were living in the district, while it was being
accumulated, probably by the action of the floods to
which, from time to time, the cave was subjected. All
the flint implements in the breccia are of the ruder and
larger form which is presented by those from the pleistocene
deposits of the Somme, Seine, and the rivers of the
south and east of England.</p>

<p>While engaged in the identification of the mammals
in 1869, with Mr. W.&nbsp;A. Sanford, I detected splinters
of bears’ canines, from the cave-earth, remarkable for
their density, crystalline structure, and semi-conchoidal
fracture, which were in the same mineral state as
those from the older breccia. One of these had been
fashioned into a flake after its mineralization, and presented
an edge chipped by use. The tooth from which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
it was struck was, probably, imbedded and mineralized
in the older breccia, then washed out of it, and afterwards
chosen for the manufacture of an implement. It
was already fossil and altered in structure in the palæolithic
age.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_141"><i>The probable Age of the Machairodus of Kent’s Hole.</i></h3>

<p>The most remarkable animal discovered in the cave,
by the Rev. J. MacEnery, is the <i class="taxonomy">Machairodus latidens</i>,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>
or large lion-like animal, armed with double-edged
canines, in shape like the blade of a sabre, and with two
serrated edges. Five canines and two incisors were dug
out of the cave-earth, <span class="smcap smaller">C</span>, in the Wolf’s Passage, along
with vast quantities of bones and teeth of the mammoth,
rhinoceros, Irish elk, horse, and hyæna. One of the
canines is represented in <a href="#Fig_101">Figs. 101, 102</a>, which are taken
from one of the original plates drawn for Dr. Buckland,
and now in the Museum of the Torquay Natural History
Society. The two incisors, <a href="#Fig_103">Figs. 103, 104, 105</a>, are
also characterised by their serrated edges. A third was
discovered by the exploration committee in the same
spot, in 1872, scarcely to be distinguished from that in
<a href="#Fig_103">Figs. 103, 104</a>, which finally dispelled the scepticism of
some eminent naturalists as to whether any of these
teeth had been obtained in the cave by the Rev. J. MacEnery.</p>

<div id="Fig_101" class="figcenter" style="width: 326px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 101, 102.</span>&mdash;Upper Canine of Machairodus, Kent’s Hole (1/1). (MacEnery.)</div></div>

<p>The <i class="taxonomy">Machairodus latidens</i> has been found in pleistocene
strata in two localities in France: in a deposit of
diluvium, near Puy, by M. Aymard, and in the cavern
of Baume in the Jura, considered by M. Lartet to be of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
preglacial age.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> In the latter it was associated with the
horse, ox, wild-boar, elephant, a non-tichorine species
of rhinoceros, the cave-bear, and the spotted hyæna. In
the autumn of 1873, I met with proof that the animal
also lived in France in the pleiocene period. M. Lortet,
the Director of the Museum of Natural History, at
Lyons, called my attention to a canine, in the Palais des
Beaux Arts, which coincides exactly in all its dimensions
with one of those from Kent’s Hole. It was found at
Chagny (Saône et Loire) near Dijon, along with <i class="taxonomy">Mastodon
arvernensis</i>, the Etruscan or megarhine species of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
rhinoceros, horse, beaver and hyæna, somewhat resembling
that from the Crag (<i class="taxonomy">Hyæna antiqua</i>) of Suffolk
described by Mr. Lankester. The species, therefore, is
pleiocene, and it belongs to a genus which is widely
distributed in the meiocene strata of Europe and North
America, as well as in the pleiocene of Europe.</p>

<p>To what era in the complicated history of Kent’s Hole
is this animal to be assigned? The more ancient, or the
more modern? The evidence on this point is, to a certain
extent, contradictory. On the one hand it is a pleiocene
species, belonging to a group of animals that inhabited
Europe before the lowering of the temperature caused
the invasion of the arctic mammalia from the north and
the east: it is moreover of a distinctly southern type.
In the teeth marks on the incisors, <a href="#Fig_103">Figs. 103, 104, 105</a>,
as well as on the canines, we have unmistakeable traces
of the presence of the hyæna; and since the spotted
hyæna abounds in the cave, to its teeth the marks in
question may probably be referred. It seems, therefore,
probable that the animal inhabited Devonshire during
an early stage of the pleistocene period, before the arctic
invaders had taken full possession of the valley of
the English Channel, and of the low grounds which
now lie within the 100-fathom line off the Atlantic
shore of Western France. There must necessarily have
been a swinging to and fro of animal life over the
great, fertile low-lying region, which is now submerged
(see Map, <a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>); and before the temperature of
France had been sufficiently lowered to exterminate or
drive out the southern forms, it is most natural to
suppose that in warm seasons some of the southern
mammalia would find their way northwards, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
a formidable carnivore such as the machairodus.
The extreme rarity of its remains forbids the hypothesis
that it was a regular inhabitant of Britain during the
pleistocene age.</p>

<div id="Fig_103" class="figcenter" style="width: 508px;">
  <img src="images/i_333.jpg" width="508" height="317" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 103, 104, 105.</span>&mdash;Incisors of Machairodus, Kent’s Hole (1/1). (MacEnery.)<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></div></div>

<p>On the other hand, the recent discovery of a second
incisor in the uppermost portion of the cave-earth, in
July 1872, in the same condition as the remains usually
found, and associated with the bones and teeth of hyæna,
horse, and bear, is considered by Sir Charles Lyell and
Mr. Pengelly proof of the animal having lived during the
deposition of the later cave-earth, or in the later stage
of the pleistocene. The condition of a bone, however, is
a very fallacious guide to its antiquity, and although the
fragments of the older contents of the cave are in a different
mineral state, it is improbable that the ossiferous
contents of so large a cave should have been mineralized
exactly in the same way. Nor is an appeal to its perfect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
state conclusive, since several teeth of bear, which I have
examined from the breccia, are equally perfect.</p>

<p>The view of the high antiquity of machairodus in
Kent’s Hole derives support from the discovery of <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros
megarhinus</i> at Oreston, a species which is very
abundant in the Italian pleiocene strata, and not uncommon
in those of France,&mdash;a species with its headquarters
in the south, but ranging as far north as Norfolk
in the early stage of the pleistocene age, represented by
the forest bed of Cromer, and that lived in the valley
of the Thames, while the gravel-beds of Crayford and
Grays Thurrock were being deposited by the ancient
river. The occurrence of either of these animals in a
cave is exceptional, and the presence of both in caves on
the edge of the great plain extending southwards from
the present coastline of Devon, seems to me to imply
that both were open during the early stage of the pleistocene,
while the pleiocene mammalia were retreating
before the southward advance of the mammoth, woolly
rhinoceros, spotted hyæna, reindeer, and their congeners,
at a time anterior to the lowering of the temperature
that culminated in the glacial period. For these reasons
it seems to me probable that the machairodus belongs
to an early rather than a late stage in the history of
Kent’s Hole.</p>

<p>There is an important point of resemblance between
the mode of the occurrence of the machairodus in Kent’s
Hole, and of the megarhine rhinoceros at Oreston. The
remains of both were met with only <em>in one spot</em>, and
were not scattered through the chambers and passages.
It may have happened that in the physical changes
which those caves have undergone, both were preserved
in a fissure like that described in the Uphill cave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
(p.&nbsp;294), and that subsequently they dropped down and
became imbedded in a newer deposit. In fixing the age
of strata in caves it seems to me that the zoological
evidence is of far greater weight than that of mere
position, which may be the result of accidental circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_142"><i>The Caves of Ireland.</i></h3>

<p>The caves of Ireland would probably afford as rich a
fauna as those of Britain, had they been explored with
equal care. In one at Shandon, near Dungarvan, Waterford,
remains of the brown bear (<i class="taxonomy">U. arctos</i>) reindeer,
horse, and mammoth were discovered in 1859, by Mr.
Brenan.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> The first of these animals became extinct in
Ireland before the historic period, while it survived in
Britain at least as late as the Roman occupation.</p>

<p>The cave-bear is also recorded by Dr. Carte,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> from the
same place, but the thigh bone assigned to it seems to
me to belong to the brown, or common species. The
mammoth, so abundant in Britain, has only been discovered
in two other localities in Ireland, at Whitechurch
near Dungarvan, and at Magherry near Belturbet.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>The range of these animals over Great Britain and
Ireland in the pleistocene age enables us to realize the
ancient physical geography, which will be treated in the
next and following chapters as part of the general question
of the physical condition of north-western Europe
at that time.</p>

<p class="in0">The caves of France have been proved, by the explorations

to contain the same animals, introduced under the same

Lunel-viel, for example, the common striped hyæna of
Africa (<i class="taxonomy">Hyæna striata</i>) has been found by Marcel de

the late M. Lartet and our countryman, Mr. Christy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span><a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>
1863&ndash;4, have not only afforded cumulative proof of the
co-existence of man with the extinct mammalia, but have
given us a clue as to the race to which he belonged.
They penetrate the sides of the valleys of the Dordogne
and Vezère at various levels, as may be seen in <a href="#Fig_71">Fig. 71</a>, and are full of the remains left behind by their
ancient inhabitants, which give as vivid a picture of the
human life of the period, as that revealed of Italian
manners in the first century by the buried cities of
Herculaneum and Pompeii. The old floors of human
occupation consist of broken bones of animals killed in
the chase, mingled with rude implements, weapons of
bone, and unpolished stone, and charcoal and burnt
stones which point out the position of the hearths.</p>

<p>Flakes (<a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>) without number, rude stone-cutters,
awls, lance-heads, hammers, saws made of flint or of chert,
rest pêle-mêle with bone needles, sculptured reindeer antlers,
engraved stones, arrow-heads, harpoons, and pointed
bones, and with the broken remains of the animals which
had been used as food, the reindeer, bison, horse, the
ibex, the saiga antelope, and the musk sheep. In some
cases the whole is compacted by a calcareous cement into
a hard mass, fragments of which are to be seen in the
principal museums of Europe. This strange accumulation
of débris marks, beyond all doubt, the place where
ancient hunters had feasted, and the broken bones and
implements are merely the refuse cast aside. The reindeer
formed by far the larger portion of the food, and must
have lived in enormous herds at that time in the centre
of France. The severity of the climate at the time may
be inferred by the presence of this animal, as well as by
the accumulation of bones on the spots on which man
had fixed his habitation. Indeed, had not this been the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
case, the decomposition of so much animal matter would
have rendered the place uninhabitable even by the lowest
savage.</p>

<p>Besides the animals mentioned above, the cave-bear
and lion have been met with in one, and the mammoth
in five localities, and their remains bear marks of cutting
or scraping, which show that they fell a prey to hunters.
The Irish elk, also, and the hyæna occur respectively in
the cave of Laugerie Basse, and of Moustier, but the latter
certainly did not gain access to the refuse-heaps, because
the vertebræ are intact which it is in the habit of eating.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
For the same reason also, M. Lartet infers that the
hunters were not aided in the chase by the dog.
There is no evidence that they were possessed of any
domestic animal. There were no spindle wheels to
indicate a knowledge of spinning, nor potsherds to show
an acquaintance with the potter’s art. In both these
respects they resemble the Fuegians, Eskimos, and Australians,
and contrast strongly with the neolithic races.</p>

<p>The broken bones show that the reindeer furnished the
more usual food, and next to that the horse, and then
the bison. And from the absence of the vertebræ and
pelvic bones of the two latter animals, M. Lartet concludes
that they were cut up where they were killed, and
the meat stripped from the backbone and the pelvis.
Their food was probably cooked by boiling, the number
of round stones used for heating water and bearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
marks of fire, like the “pot boilers” of some of the
American Indians, being very considerable.</p>

<p>Among the stone implements flint flakes were incredibly
numerous, and the number of chips scattered
about as well as the blocks of flint from which they had
been struck, proved that they had been made on the
spot; most of these flakes were notched by use (<a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>). Instruments with the ends carefully rounded off
(<a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a>) were also abundant, and from their analogy
with similar instruments used by the Eskimos, there
can be but little doubt that they were intended for the
preparation of skins (compare <a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a> with <a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>).
The ends of some were chipped to a point for insertion
into a handle, while others rounded at both ends were
probably used freely in the hand. In the cave of Moustier
oval implements were met with, resembling those
figured from the caverns of Kent’s Hole and Wookey
(<a href="#Fig_84">Figs. 84</a> and <a href="#Fig_97">97</a>). The spear, javelin, and arrow-heads
of flint presented two modes of attachment to the shaft,
the base of some being squared off with a notch above
for the ligature (as in <a href="#Fig_108">Fig. 108</a>), while in others (<a href="#Fig_109">Fig. 109</a>) it tapered off into a point intended for insertion.
This latter form has been obtained also in Kent’s Hole.</p>

<p>The bone needles are carefully smoothed, and were
pierced with a neatly-made eye (<a href="#Fig_110">Fig. 110</a>) by means of
pointed flakes which were found along with them, and
the use of which M. Lartet demonstrated by experiment.
They had been sawn out of the compact metacarpals
and tarsals of the reindeer<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> and the horse,
and subsequently rounded on fragments of sandstone,
the grooves of which fitted them. In this, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>
we have not merely the evidence that the hunters were
in the habit of sewing, but also we have vividly brought
before us the very method by which their needles were
manufactured. They were probably used for sewing
skins together, the tendon of a reindeer forming the
thread, as among the modern Eskimos.</p>

<p>The heads of arrows and lances are made principally
out of reindeer antler, and are barbed, the barbs generally
being grooved, and carved on both sides of the axis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig_111">Figs. 111, 112, 113</a>); but in some cases, as in <a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 114</a>,
the barbs are only on one side. Many bones and antlers
are variously carved into shapes for which it is impossible

<p>The most remarkable remains left behind by man in
these refuse-heaps are the sculptured reindeer antlers,
and the figures engraved on fragments of schist and on
ivory. A well-defined outline of an ox stands out
boldly from one piece of antler. A second presents us
with a most elegant design: a reindeer is kneeling down
in an easy attitude with its head thrown up in the air,
so that the antlers rest on the shoulders, and the back
of the animal forms an even surface for a handle, which
is too small to be grasped in an ordinary European hand
(<a href="#Fig_116">Fig. 116</a>). In a third a man stands close to a horse’s
head, and hard by is a fish like an eel; and on the other
side of the same cylinder are two heads of bison, drawn
with sufficient clearness to ensure recognition by anyone
who had ever seen that animal (<a href="#Fig_117">Fig. 117</a>). On a fourth the
natural curvature of one of the tines has been taken advantage
of by the artist to engrave the head, and the
characteristic recurved horns of the ibex; and on a
fifth are figures of horses (<a href="#Fig_118">Fig. 118</a>), in which the upright
disheveled mane and shaggy ungroomed tail are represented
with admirable spirit. At first sight it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
appear that the artist had drawn the heads out of all
proportion to the bodies. A horse’s skeleton, however,
from the palæolithic “station” at Solutré, lately set up
in the Museum at Lyons, proves that this is not the case,
since, as M. Lortet pointed out to me, it is remarkable
for its massive head, and small body. In <a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a> a
group of reindeer are seen, two on their backs, and
two in the act of walking. The Irish elk, red-deer,
and probably rhinoceros, are also depicted, the figures
upon the hard schist being feebly and uncertainly drawn,
as might be expected from the character of the tools.
The most clever sculptor of modern times would,
probably, not succeed very much better if his graver
was a splinter of flint, and stone and bone were the
materials to be engraved. One peculiarity runs through
the figures of animals. With but two exceptions none<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
of the feet are represented, a circumstance which is
probably due, as Mr. Franks has suggested to me, to the
fact that the hunters merely represented what they saw
of the animal, of which the feet would be concealed by
the herbage.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 119.</span>&mdash;Group of Reindeer, Dordogne. (Broca.)</div></div>

<p>The most striking figure that has been discovered
is that of the mammoth,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> <a href="#Fig_120">Fig. 120</a>, engraved on a fragment
of its own tusk, the peculiar spiral curvature of
the tusk and the long mane, which are not now to be
found in any living elephant, proving that the original
was familiar to the eye of the artist. The discovery
of whole carcases of the animal in northern Siberia,
preserved from decay in the frozen cliffs and morasses,
has made us acquainted with the existence of the long
hairy mane. Had not it thus been handed down to
our eyes, we should probably have treated this most
accurate drawing as a mere artist’s freak. Its peculiarities
are so faithfully depicted that it is quite impossible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
for the animal to be confounded with either of the
two living species. These drawings probably employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
the idle hours of the hunter, and perpetuate the scenes
which he witnessed in the chase. They are full of artistic
feeling, and are evidently drawn from life. The mammoth
is engraved on its own ivory, the reindeer generally
on reindeer antler, and the stag on stag antler.</p>

<p>From all these facts we must picture to our minds, that
these ancient dwellers in the caves of Aquitaine lived by
hunting and fishing, that they were acquainted with
fire, and that they were clad with skins sewn together
with sinews or strips of intestines. That they did not
possess the dog is shown, not merely by the negative
evidence of its not having been discovered, but also by
the fact that the bones which it invariably eats, such
as the vertebræ, are preserved. They did not possess
any domestic animals, and there is no evidence that
they were acquainted with the potter’s art. M. de
Mortillet’s view, that the art of making pottery was
unknown in the palæolithic age, seems to me to be
probably true, the reputed cases of the discovery of
potsherds being always connected with suspicious circumstances,
which render it probable that they were
subsequently introduced.</p>

<p>Besides the remains of the animals in the refuse-heaps
were fragmentary portions of human skeletons, which,
however, were not scraped or broken so as to imply the
practice of cannibalism.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_146"><i>Caves of Belgium.</i></h3>

<div id="Fig_121" class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 121.</span>&mdash;Carved Implement of Reindeer Antler, Goyet (1/2). (Dupont.)</div></div>

<p>The researches of Dr. Schmerling<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> into the caves of
Belgium, in 1829&ndash;30, revealed the fact that the animals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
so abundant in the caves of Germany, were equally
numerous in those in the neighbourhood of Liége, and
the flint flakes, and the fragments of human bones, which
he found may possibly be of palæolithic age. He also
discovered the remains of the porcupine, a species no
longer living north of the Alps and Pyrenees. The
systematic exploration, however, of the palæolithic caves
in that district was not carried out until, in the year
1864, M. Dupont<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> began the investigation of those in
the neighbourhood of Dinant-sur-Meuse, on behalf of
the Belgian Government. His results, based upon the
examination of upwards of twenty caves and rock-shelters,
are published in a series of papers read before
the Royal Academy of Belgium and subsequently in a
separate work. Besides the remains of the animals
living in Belgium within the historic period, he met
with the ibex, chamois, and marmot, which are now to
be found only in the mountainous districts of Europe,
the tailless hare, lemming, and arctic fox, of the
northern regions, the <i class="taxonomy">Antelope saiga</i>, grizzly bear, lion,
hyæna, and others. Most of these species occurred in
refuse accumulations, their remains being in the fragmentary
condition of those of the French caves. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
associated implements are of the same type as those of
Périgord, and some of them are ornamented in the same
manner as, for example, that from the cavern of Goyet,
<a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>, termed a “bâton de commandement,” but
which, from its analogy with similar articles in the
British Museum, is most probably an arrow-straightener.
Those of flint are also of the same kind, and in several
of the caves there was the same association of fragmentary
human remains with the relics of the feasts as
in the French refuse-heaps.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_147"><i>Trou de Naulette.</i></h3>

<p>The human remains consisting of a lower jaw, ulna
and metatarsal, discovered in the large cavern of Naulette,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>
on the left bank of the Lesse, in association with the
broken remains of the rhinoceros, mammoth, reindeer,
chamois, and marmot, are undoubtedly of palæolithic
age, since they rested in an undisturbed stratum. M.
Dupont gives the following section in descending order.</p>

<p>The human jaw is remarkable for its prognathism,
which, according to Dr. Hamy, is greater than that which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>
has been observed in any living races. The cave had
afforded shelter to the hyænas before it had been used
by man.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_148"><i>The Caves of Switzerland.</i></h3>

<p>The caves of Switzerland also contain the same class of
rude implements and carvings. Prof. Rupert Jones has
called my attention to a recent discovery of carved reindeer
antlers, and harpoon-heads, similar to those figured
from the Dordogne, in a cave in the Canton of Schaaffhausen,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>
along with the bones of hyæna, reindeer, and
mammoth. In that of Veyrier,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> carved implements were
found along with the remains of the ox, horse, chamois,
and ibex, some of which, shown to me by Dr. Gosse, at
the meeting of the French Association for the Advancement
of Science, at Lyons in 1873, are of the same form
and size as the arrow-straightener from the cave of Goyet
(<a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>).</p>

<p>We may, therefore, infer that the same palæolithic
race of men once ranged over the whole region from the
Pyrenees and Switzerland, as far to the north as Belgium.
And since Prof. Fraas has obtained similar implements
from a refuse-heap at Schussenreid in Würtemberg, they
wandered as far to the east as that district, while the
discoveries in Kent’s Hole and Wookey Hole prove that
they extended as far to the west as Somersetshire and
Devonshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_149"><i>Cave-dwellers and Palæolithic Men of the River-gravels.</i></h3>

<p>These palæolithic cave-dwellers are considered by Mr.
Evans<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> to belong to the same race as those who have left
their rude flint implements in the river-gravels in the
valleys of the Thames, the Somme, the Seine, and in the
eastern counties, as far to the north as Peterborough.
We must, however, allow that a marked difference is to
be observed between a series of flint implements found
in the caves, as compared with a series found in the river-strata,
although some forms are common to the two; as
for instance some of those found in Brixham and Kent’s
Hole. This difference can scarcely be explained on the
supposition that the small things would be less likely to
be preserved in the fluviatile deposits, because it leaves
the rarity in the caves of the larger fluviatile forms unaccounted
for. It is perhaps safer, in the present state
of our knowledge, to consider the two sets to be distinct
from each other. The direct superposition in Kent’s
Hole of the stratum with the ordinary cave-type of implement,
over that with the ordinary fluviatile type,
may perhaps prove that the latter is the older.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_150"><i>Classification of Palæolithic Caves.</i></h3>

<p>The palæolithic caves are divided by M. Lartet<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> into
four groups, according to the species of animals which
they contain; into those of the age of the cave-bear, of
the age of the mammoth and woolly rhinoceros, of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
age of the reindeer, and of the age of bison. Dr. Hamy
follows Sir John Lubbock,<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> in considering the age of the
cave-bear to be co-extensive with that of the mammoth,
and in the classification of caves he adopts a series of
transitions. M. Dupont divides the caves of Belgium
into those belonging to the age of the mammoth, and to
that of the reindeer.</p>

<p>It is easy to refer a given cave to the age of the reindeer
or of the mammoth because it contains the remains
of those animals, but the division has been rendered
worthless for chronological purposes, by the fact that
both these animals inhabited the region north of the Alps
and Pyrenees at the same time, and are to be found
together in nearly every bone-cave explored in that area.
The difference between the contents of one palæolithic
cave and another, is probably largely due to the fact that
man could more easily catch some animals than others,
as well as to the preference for one kind of food before
another. And the abundance of the reindeer, which is
supposed to characterise the reindeer period, may reasonably
be accounted for by the fact, that it would be more
easily captured by a savage hunter, than the mammoth,
woolly rhinoceros, cave-bear, lion, or hyæna. The classification
will apply, as I have shown in my essay on the
pleistocene mammalia,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> neither to the caves of this
country, of Belgium, nor of France, and my views are
shared by M. de Mortillet,<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> after a careful and independent
examination of the whole evidence.</p>

<p>The division of the caves also into ages, according to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
the various types of implements found in them, proposed
by M. de Mortillet, seems to be equally unsatisfactory;
for there is no greater difference in the implements of any
two of the palæolithic caves, than is to be observed between
those of two different tribes of Eskimos, while the
general resemblance is most striking. The principle of
classification by the relative rudeness, assumes that the
progress of man has been gradual, and that the ruder
implements are therefore the older. The difference, however,
may have been due to different tribes, or families,
having co-existed without intercourse with each other,
as is now generally the case with savage communities;
or to the supply of flint, chert, and other materials for
cutting instruments, being greater in one region than in
another.</p>

<p>Can these cave-dwellers be identified with any people
now living on the face of the earth? or are they as completely
without representatives as their extinct contemporaries,
the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros?
Absolute certainty we cannot hope to obtain on the
point, but the cumulative evidence enables an answer to
be given which is probably true. Along the American
shore of the great Arctic Ocean, in the region of everlasting
snow, dwell the Eskimos, living by hunting and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
fishing, speaking the same
language, and using the
same implements from the
Straits of Behring on the
west, to Greenland on the
east. Their implements and
weapons, brought home by
the arctic explorers, enable
us to institute a comparison
with those found in
the palæolithic caves. The
harpoons in the Ashmolean
collection at Oxford,
brought over by Captain
Beechey and Lieut. Harding
from West Georgia, as
well as those in the British
Museum, are almost identical
in shape and design
with those from the caves
of Aquitaine and Kent’s
Hole; the only difference
being that some of the
latter have grooved barbs.
The heads of the fowling
and fishing spears, darts,
and arrows, as well as the
form of their bases for insertion
into the shafts, are
also identical (<a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a>), as
may be seen from a comparison
of <a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a> with
<a href="#Fig_99">Figs. 99</a> and <a href="#Fig_113">114</a>. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
curiously carved instrument, <a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a>, which the Eskimos
use for straightening their arrows is variously
ornamented with designs of animals, analogous to those
cut on the reindeer antlers in Aquitaine; and if it be
compared with the so-called “bâton de commandement,”
<a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>, it will be seen, that the latter also was probably
intended for the same purpose;
the difference in the shape
of the hole in the two figured
specimens being also observable
in the series of Eskimos arrow-straighteners
in the British Museum,
and being largely due to
friction by use. Many of the implements
are the same in form. An
Eskimos stone scraper for preparing
skins, or plane for smoothing wood,
is represented in <a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>, which
is inserted in a handle of fossil
mammoth ivory, obtained from the
frozen ice-cliffs on the shores of the
Arctic sea. If it be compared with
<a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a> from the caves, it will be
seen to be of the same pattern. It
is indeed not a little singular, that
the handle in which it is imbedded
should have been formed out of the
tusks of the same species of elephant
as that which was depicted by the palæolithic
hunter (see <a href="#Fig_120">Fig. 120</a>), in the south of France.</p>

<p>Some of the Eskimos lance-heads of stone in the
British Museum are of the same type as that figured
from the caves of the Dordogne (<a href="#Fig_108">Fig. 108</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
The most remarkable objects brought home from the
northern regions are the implements of bone and antler
which are ornamented with the figures of animals hunted
by the Eskimos on sea or land. On the side of one bow
in the Ashmolean Museum, used for drilling holes, you
see them harpooning the whale from their skin boats,
and catching birds. On a second they are harpooning
walrus and catching seals; on a third the seals are being
dragged home. The huts in which they live, the tethered
dogs, the boat supported on its platform, and their daily
occupations are faithfully represented. One bow is
ornamented with a large number of porpoises, while
on another is a reindeer hunt in which the animals are
being attacked while they are crossing a ford. On a bone
implement in the British Museum from Fort Clarence,
the reindeer are being shot down by archers (<a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a>).
The arrow straightener, <a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a>, is adorned with a
reindeer hunting scene, in which the animals are seen
browsing and unsuspicious of the approach of the hunters,
who are advancing, clad in reindeer skins and wearing
antlers on their heads.</p>

<p>A comparison of these various designs with those
from the caves of France and Belgium shows an identity
of plan and workmanship, with this difference only, that
the hunting scenes familiar to the palæolithic cave-dweller
were not the same as those familiar to the
Eskimos on the shores of the Arctic Ocean. Each sculptured
the animals he knew, and the whale, walrus, and
seal were unknown to the inland dwellers in Aquitaine,
just as the mammoth, bison, and wild horse are unknown
to the Eskimos. The reindeer, which they both knew,
is represented in the same way by both. The West
Georgians made their dirks of walrus tooth, and ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>
them with carvings of the backbones of fishes;
the people of Aquitaine used for the same purpose reindeer
antlers, and ornamented them with figures of that
animal (see <a href="#Fig_116">Fig. 116</a>). And it is worthy of remark that
the latter had sufficient artistic feeling to depict the
mammoth on mammoth ivory, the reindeer generally on
reindeer antler, and the stag on its own antler.</p>

<div id="Fig_125" class="figcenter" style="width: 527px;">
  <img src="images/i_357.jpg" width="527" height="81" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 125.</span>&mdash;Eskimos Hunting-scene (1/1). (Fort Clarence.)</div></div>

<p>An appeal to the habits of these two peoples, now
separated by so wide an interval of space and time, tends
also to show that they are descended from the same
stock. The method of accumulating large quantities of
the bones of animals around their dwelling-places, and the
habit of splitting the bones for the sake of the marrow,
is the same in both. Their hides were prepared by the
same sort of instruments and in the same manner, and
the needles with which they were sewn together are of
the same pattern. The few remains of man among the
relics of feasts in the caves of Belgium and France, show
the same disregard of sepulture as that implied by the
human skulls lying about along with numerous bones of
walrus, seal, dog, bear, and fox, in an Eskimos camp in
Igloolik, which were carried away by Captain Lyon,
without the slightest objection on the part of the relatives
of the dead.</p>

<p>All these facts can hardly be mere coincidences, caused
by both peoples leading a savage life under similar circumstances:
they afford reasons for the belief that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>
the Eskimos of North America are connected by blood
with the palæolithic cave-dwellers of Europe. To the
objection that savage tribes living under similar conditions
use similar instruments, and that, therefore, the
correspondence of those of the Eskimos with those of the
reindeer folk does not prove that they belong to the
same race, the answer may be made, that there are no
two savage tribes now living which use the same set of
implements, without being connected by blood. The
agreement of one or two of the more common and ruder
instruments may be perhaps of no value in classification,
but if a whole set agree, fitted for various uses, and some
of them rising above the most common wants of savage
life, we must admit that the argument as to race is
of very great value. The implements found in Belgium,
France, or Britain differ scarcely more from those now
used in West Georgia, than the latter do from those now
in use in Greenland or Melville Peninsula. The conclusion,
therefore, seems inevitable, that so far as we have
any evidence of the race to which the dwellers in the
Dordogne belong, that evidence points only in the direction
of the Eskimos.</p>

<p>This conclusion is to a great extent confirmed by a
consideration of the animals found in the caves. The
reindeer and the musk sheep afford food to the Eskimos
now, just as they afforded it to the palæolithic hunters in
Europe. No naturalist would deny that the pleistocene
musk sheep is of the same species as that of North America,
and although the animal is extinct in Europe and
Asia, its remains, scattered through Germany, Russia in
Europe, and Siberia, show that it formerly ranged in the
whole of that area. The enormous distance, therefore, of
southern France from the northern shores of America,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>
cannot be considered as an obstacle to this view, for, to
say the least, palæolithic man would have had the same
chance of retreating to the north-east as the musk sheep.
The mammoth and bison have also been tracked by
their remains in the frozen river gravels and morasses
through Siberia, as far to the north-east as the American
side of the Straits of Behring. Palæolithic man appeared
in Europe with the arctic mammalia, lived in Europe
along with them, and disappeared with them. And
since his implements are of the same kind as those of
the Eskimos, it may reasonably be concluded that he is
represented at the present time by the Eskimos, for it is
most improbable that the convergence of the ethnological,
and zoological evidence should be an accident.
These views,<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> which I advanced in 1866, have been to
a great extent accepted by Sir John Lubbock in his last
edition of Prehistoric Man.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_152"><i>Pleistocene Animals living to the North of the Alps
and Pyrenees.</i></h3>

<p>The principal mammalia inhabiting Britain, France,
and Germany during the pleistocene age, and contemporary
with man in Europe, are given in the following
table, which shows that the fauna of the region to
the north of the Alps and Pyrenees was remarkably
uniform. The cave-fauna of Provence, Italy, and Spain,
will be treated of in the next chapter.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_153"><i>Cave Fauna the same as River-bed Fauna.</i></h3>

<p>If this list<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> of animals from the caves be compared
with that of the river-deposits of Britain and the continent,
it will be seen that the same fauna is present in
both, and that they are therefore of the same geological
age.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> This was the conclusion to which Dr. Falconer
was led by the examination of the caves of Gower, and
it has been confirmed by every subsequent discovery.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_154"><i>The Pleistocene Coast-line of North-Western Europe.</i></h3>

<p>The identity of the British pleistocene fauna with that
of the continent, leads to the conclusion that in the
pleistocene age Britain was connected with the adjacent
countries by a bridge of land, over which the wild animals
had free means of migration. And this might be brought
about by a comparatively small elevation of the area.
The soundings show that Britain and Ireland constitute
merely the uplands of a plateau now submerged to the
extent of about 100 fathoms, on the side of the Atlantic.
On the east it extends at a depth of from twenty to
fifty fathoms, in the direction of Belgium; and on the
south it is only sunk from twenty to forty fathoms below
the sea-level. Immediately to the westward of this
line the sea deepens so suddenly, that there is scarcely
any difference between the lines of 100 and of 200<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>
fathoms, and the depth rapidly increases to 2,000. Were
this plateau elevated above the sea to an extent of 100<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span>
fathoms, the tract shaded in the map (<a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>) would
unite the British Isles to the continent, and the Thames
and other rivers on the eastern coast would unite with
the Elbe and the Rhine to form a river debouching on
the North Sea, somewhat after the manner which I have
represented by taking the deepest line of soundings. The
Straits of Dover would then be the watershed between
this valley of the German Ocean, as it may be termed,
and that of the English Channel, in which the Seine and
the Somme and other French rivers joined those of the
south coast, and ultimately reached the Atlantic. Evidence
that the latter river flowed in the course assigned
to it in the map is afforded by the discovery of the
fresh-water mussel (<i class="taxonomy">Unio pictorum</i>), recorded by Mr.
Godwin Austen<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> to have been dredged up by Captain
White from a depth of from 50 to 100 fathoms, not
very far from what I have taken to be its mouth. We
are also indebted to Mr. Godwin Austen for the
discovery near this spot of banks of shingle and littoral
shells, which indicate the position of the ancient
coast-line.</p>

  <p>Shaded area = land now submerged; dotted area = region occupied by animals;<br />
  plain area = region occupied by glaciers.</p></div></div>

<p>The view that the 100-fathom line marks the limit of
the pleistocene land surface to the west, is held by Sir
H. de la Bêche, Mr. Godwin Austen, Sir Charles Lyell,
and other eminent geologists, and it is supported by
many facts that can be explained in no other manner.
To pass over the discovery of a fresh-water shell at the
bottom of the English Channel, quoted above, the distribution
of fossil mammalia at the bottom of the German
Ocean (represented in <a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a> by the dotted area) is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span>
analogous to that which we find in the river gravels and
brick-earths on the land. The quantity of teeth and
bones belonging to the mammoth, woolly rhinoceros,
horse, reindeer, and spotted hyæna, and other animals,
dredged up by the fishermen in the German Ocean is
almost incredible. Mr. Owles, of Yarmouth, informed
me in 1868 that off that place there is a bank on which
the fishing nets are rarely cast without bringing up
fossil remains. It seems most probable, that these accumulations
have been formed under subaerial conditions near
the drinking places, or below the fords, which were
used for ages by the pleistocene animals. I might quote
as an example of a similar deposit of fossils on the land,
that discovered in 1866 by Captain Luard, R.E., in
digging the foundations of the new cavalry barracks at
Windsor, which consisted mainly of bones and antlers
of reindeer, with a few carnivores, such as the brown
bear and wolf, that usually follow reindeer in their
migrations in Siberia.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> Were this submerged it would
be a case precisely similar to that off Yarmouth.</p>

<p>The ancient forest, exposed at low water under the
cliffs on the Norfolk and Suffolk shores, flourished when
the land stood higher than it does now. Traces of a
similar forest, also at, and below, low-water mark, have
been met with on the shore at Selsea, near Chichester,
in Sussex; and remains of the mammoth have been
dredged up in several places off the coast, as for example
in Torbay and in Holyhead harbour, or found in gravel
beds near low-water mark, as in the Isle of Wight, and
on the north coast of Somerset at St. Audries, near
Watchet, where a skull with gigantic tusks rested in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">366</a></span>
gravel. In all these facts we have ample proof that
Britain stood at a higher level in the pleistocene age
than at the present day.</p>

<p>The vast abundance also of the mammalia in the caves
of South Wales and Somerset, and their presence in the
Island of Caldy, and it may be added in Ireland, can
only be accounted for by the elevation of the present
sea-bottom, so as to allow of their migration over
plains covered with abundant pasture. It seems, therefore,
to me that the accompanying map, <a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>, represents
with tolerable accuracy the ancient coast-line of
Britain, and of the adjacent parts of the continent in
the pleistocene age. The fertile valleys of the English
Channel, Bristol Channel, and the German Ocean, would
afford sustenance to a large and varied fauna, and
numerous herbivores, such as the reindeer, bison, and
horse, would supply food to the palæolithic hunters, who
followed them in their annual migrations. And it must
be remarked on this hypothesis, that the valley of the
Garonne would offer a free passage both to the animals
and to the hunters of Auvergne down to the prairie, extending
as far as the 100-fathom line off the French
coast, and that the hunting grounds would reach to
Devonshire and Somerset without any barrier except that
offered by the rivers. It is therefore no wonder that the
implements in the caves of Kent’s Hole, Wookey Hole,
and the South of France, should be of the same type.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_155"><i>Distribution of Palæolithic Implements in this Area.</i></h3>

<p>This geographical configuration in pleistocene times
may perhaps account for the distribution of the palæolithic
implements in the river gravels. The Seine and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">367</a></span>
the Somme debouch into the same valley as the rivers of
the south of England, and the Straits of Dover mark the
position of a low watershed leading into the valley of
the German Ocean, on the sides of which, in the eastern
counties, river-bed implements are so numerous. These
are of the same type in northern France, Sussex, Hampshire,
Kent, and as far north as the Wash; and were
therefore used by the same race of men. The difference
between them and those of the cave-dwellers in the south
and west, may be due to their possessors occupying different
hunting grounds. Each tribe of American Indians
at the present time has its own territory for hunting,
which is jealously guarded against encroachment, and
in which the articles peculiar to the tribe are being
accumulated in the refuse-heaps, while other sets are
being accumulated in other districts. If we suppose that
the palæolithic savages divided up their hunting grounds
in this manner, the difference which exists between the
implements of the river-beds and caves may be readily
explained, as well as their being found for the most part
in different areas.</p>

<p>The pleistocene climate in the area north of the Alps
and Pyrenees will be treated in the <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">eleventh</a> chapter,
after the examination of the cave-fauna of southern
Europe.</p>

<p class="in0">In the preceding chapter we have seen that north-western
Europe was elevated, during the pleistocene age, to an
extent of at least 600 feet above its present level; so
that Ireland was united to Britain, and Britain was
joined to the mainland of Europe, proof of this elevation
being dependent upon the soundings on one hand,
and the distribution of the fossil mammalia on the other.
Such a change must necessarily have affected the whole
physical conditions of the area, since the substitution of
a mass of land for a stretch of sea, and the higher altitude
of the land, would tend to produce climatal extremes of
considerable severity. It is indeed no wonder that
during this time of continental elevation, the hills of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span>
Wales, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Cumbria, and Scotland
should be crowned with glaciers, or that there should
have been a migration to and fro of animals, comparable
to that which is now going on in Siberia and the
northern portions of North America. The condition of
southern Europe at that time has a most important
bearing on any conclusion which may be drawn as to
the pleistocene climate in France, Germany, or Britain.
For if it be proved that the Mediterranean Sea was then
smaller than it is now, the greater land-surface would
increase both the heat of the summer and the cold of
the winter in central and north-western Europe.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_156"><i>Changes of Level in Mediterranean area in Meiocene
and Pleiocene Ages.</i></h3>

<p>The geological evidence that the Mediterranean region
has been subjected to oscillations of level during
the tertiary period, is clear and decisive. Prof. Gaudry<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a>
has proved, in his work on the fossil remains found at
Pikermi, that the plains of Marathon, now so restricted,
must have extended in the meiocene age far south into
the Mediterranean, so as to afford pasture to the enormous
troops of hipparions and herds of antelopes, the mastodons
and large edentata, revealed by his enterprise. The
rocky area of Attica, as now constituted, could not have
supported such a large and varied group of animals, nor
could the broken hills and limestone plateaux have been
inhabited by hipparions and antelopes, if their habits at
all resembled those of their descendants living at the
present time. It may, therefore, reasonably be concluded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">370</a></span>
that Greece, in those times, was prolonged southwards,
and united to the islands of the Archipelago by a stretch
of land. If Africa were then as now the head-quarters
of the antelopes, it is very probable that one of the lines
by which they passed over into Europe, and spread over
France and Germany, was in this direction. Nevertheless,
it must be admitted that the changes of level, which
have taken place since the meiocene age in those regions,
are so complicated as to render it almost impossible to
restore the meiocene geography.</p>

<p>In the succeeding, or the pleiocene age, the presence
of the African hippopotamus in Italy, France, and Germany,
can only be accounted for by a more direct connection
with the African mainland than is offered by a
route through Asia Minor. It would seem, therefore,
that the Mediterranean Sea could not then have formed
the same barrier to the northern migration of the animals
which it does now. In many regions, however, the
present land was then sunk beneath the sea, and marine
strata, of pleiocene age, were accumulated in the Val
d’Arno, Sicily, and southern France.</p>

<p>The physical geography<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> of the Mediterranean in the
pleistocene age may be ascertained with considerable
accuracy by the distribution of the animals, coupled with
the evidence of the soundings.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_157"><i>Bone-caves of Southern Europe.</i></h3>

<p>The mammalia in the bone-caves of southern Europe
differ from those of the region north of the Alps and
Pyrenees in the absence of the arctic species, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">371</a></span>
presence of some which are of a more strictly southern
type. Nevertheless, the influence of the mountains in
lowering the temperature in their neighbourhood is to be
traced in the presence of the remains of certain animals.
Thus, in the caves of Gibraltar we find an ibex, which
cannot be distinguished from those of the Spanish sierras,
and in Mentone and Provence, a marmot, specifically
identical with that of the Alps.</p>

<p>The bone-caves in the neighbourhood of the Mediterranean
afford most important testimony as to the geographical
changes which have taken place, since the
animals found in them lived in that region. We will
take those of the Iberian peninsula first.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_158"><i>Caves of Gibraltar.</i></h3>

<p>Ossiferous caverns have long been known to occur in
the fortified rock of Gibraltar,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> but were not examined
scientifically until the year 1863, when the researches of
Captain Brome, Prof. Busk, and Dr. Falconer, proved that
pleistocene species were buried in considerable numbers
in its cavities and fissures. Of these the most important
is the great perpendicular fissure in Windmill Hill, called
the Genista cave, which has been traced down to more
than a depth of 200 feet. From the upper portion
were obtained the polished stone implements, human
skulls, and other neolithic remains described in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_VI">sixth</a> chapter, <a href="#Page_204">p. 204</a>, which prove that Gibraltar was
inhabited by the Basques in the neolithic age, while
the remains from the lower revealed the presence of a
singularly mixed group of animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">372</a></span>
The fossil bones have been referred by Prof. Busk and
Dr. Falconer to the following <span class="locked">species:&mdash;</span></p>

<p id="list_372" class="in0 in4">
<i class="taxonomy">Lepus cuniculus</i>, rabbit.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">Felis leo</i>, lion.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">F. pardus</i>, panther.<br />

<i class="taxonomy">Cervus elaphus</i>, red deer.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">C. capreolus</i>, roe.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">C. dama</i>, fallow deer.
</p>

<p>The spotted hyæna, the serval, and <i class="taxonomy">Felis caffer</i>, are
species now peculiar to Africa, and it is obvious that
they could not have found their way into Gibraltar
under the present physical conditions of the Mediterranean.
Elephants and rhinoceroses could not have lived
on so barren and treeless a rock, unless it had overlooked
a fertile plain, nor would the carnivora have chosen it
for their dens, had it then been cut off from the feeding-grounds
of the herbivores. Their presence, therefore, as
Dr. Falconer justly remarks, implies the existence of
land now sunk beneath the waves, but then extending
southwards to join Africa.</p>

<p>To the African animals, mentioned above as inhabiting
the Iberian peninsula in the pleistocene age, M.
Lartet has added the African elephant (<i class="taxonomy">E. Africanus</i>)
and the striped hyæna (<i class="taxonomy">II. striata</i>), which have been
found in a stratum of gravel near Madrid along with
flint implements.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> None of the purely arctic mammalia,
such as the reindeer, musk sheep, or woolly rhinoceros,
so abundant in France, Germany, and Britain, have been
met with south of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_159"><i>Bone-caves of Provence and Mentone.</i></h3>

<p>The arctic animals are also absent from the numerous
bone-caves and bone breccias of Provence and Mentone.
The pleistocene fauna of Provence consists, according to
M. Marion,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> of the spotted hyæna, and lion, <i class="taxonomy">Elephas
antiquus</i> or straight-tusked elephant, <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros hemitœchus</i>,
wild-boar, urus, stag, horse, and rabbit. The
breccias in the island of Ratonneau have also furnished
the porcupine, brown bear, and tailless hare. Man is
proved to have been living in the district at the time by
the discovery of perforated and cut bones, in the cave of
Rians.</p>

<p>The fissures and caves of Mentone, explored by Mr.
Moggridge<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> in 1871, and subsequently by M. Rivière,
contained a fauna composed, according to Prof. Busk, of
the following <span class="locked">species:&mdash;</span></p>

<p id="list_373" class="in0 in4">

Mr. Moggridge gives the following account of the
results of his exploration:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>“The caves of the red rocks, half a mile out of Mentone,
are in lofty rocks of jurassic limestone on the shore
of the Mediterranean, and at an average height of 100
feet above that sea, the rocks themselves attaining an
elevation of 260 feet. They have now been repeatedly
rifled by the learned or the curious; but when the
principal cave (Cavillon) was nearly intact, the author
made a section of it from the modern or highest floor,
down to the solid rock. There were five floors formed
in the earth by long-continued trampling; on each, and
near the centre, were marks of fire, around which broken
bones and flints were abundant, except upon the lowest,
where but few bones occurred, and no flints. The bones
were those of animals still existing. Few implements
were found, but many chips of flint, some cores and
stones used as hammers. Perhaps this cave was used as
a place for manufacturing flints, which must have been
carried from their native bed, distant about one mile.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to evince the action of water; on
the contrary, the numerous stones that occur are all
angular.... Below these caves a slope of about 180
feet descends to the edge of the sea. Through the upper
part of this slope, at distances from the cave of from 0
to ten feet, is a railway cutting 600 feet long, fifty-four
feet deep, and sixty feet above the sea. The mass removed
in making this cutting was composed of angular
stones not waterworn. Loose at the surface, it soon
became a more or less mature breccia, for the most part
so hard that it was blasted with gunpowder.” In this
breccia, and at various depths, some of more than thirty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span>
feet, the author has taken out teeth of the bear (<i class="taxonomy">Ursus
spelæus</i>) and of the hyæna (<i class="taxonomy">Hyæna spelæa</i>) while with
and below those teeth he found flints worked by man.</p>

<p>The subsequent exploration by M. Rivière<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> has resulted
in no important addition to the fauna: the famous
human skeleton having been, as I have already remarked
in the <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">seventh</a> chapter, interred in the pleistocene strata,
and probably not palæolithic. It may possibly be of the
era of the upper floors described by Mr. Moggridge, in
which all the remains belong to living species.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></p>

<p>This cave-fauna is more closely related to that of
southern Europe than to that north of the Alps and
Pyrenees. The striped hyæna found in the cave of
Lunel-viel, Hérault, by Marcel de Serres, along with
the reindeer and other animals, probably belongs to the
same southern group.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_160"><i>Bone-caves of Sicily.</i></h3>

<p>Certain members of the African fauna are also proved
to have ranged northwards over Europe in the direction
of Sicily, by the discoveries in the caves of that island.
The Sicilian bone-caves have been worked for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">376</a></span>
of the bones since the year 1829; and of these many
shiploads were sent to Marseilles from San Ciro, belonging,
according to M. de Christol, principally to the
hippopotamus. In 1859,<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> Dr. Falconer examined the
collections made from this cave, as well as those which
remained <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i>, and carried on further researches into
a second in the neighbourhood, known as the Grotto di
Maccagnone, and in the following year two others were
discovered and explored in northern Sicily by Baron
Anca. The species were as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<i class="taxonomy">Hippopotamus Pentlandi.</i><br />
<i class="taxonomy">Lepus.</i>
</p>

<p>The presence of man was indicated by charcoal and
flint flakes.</p>

<p>The African elephant was obtained from three caves:
from that of San Teodoro, by Baron Anca; from Grotta
Santa, near Syracuse, by the Canon Alessi; and from a
cave near Palermo, by M. Charles Gaudin. It is obvious
that the presence of this animal, as well as of the spotted
hyæna, in Sicily can only be accounted for on the hypothesis
that a bridge of land formerly existed, by which
they could pass from their head-quarters, that is to say
Africa. On the other hand the presence of the grizzly
bear, and of the <i class="taxonomy">Elephas antiquus</i> implies that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">377</a></span>
passed over into Sicily, from their European headquarters,
before the existence of the Straits of Messina,
since both animals are abundant on the mainland of
Europe. The larger species of hippopotamus, doubtfully
referred by Dr. Falconer to the <i class="taxonomy">H. major</i> (= <i class="taxonomy">H. amphibius</i>),
may have crossed over either from Italy, where
its remains are very abundant in the pleiocene and
pleistocene strata, or from Africa.</p>

<p>A small species of hippopotamus, <i class="taxonomy">H. Pentlandi</i>, <a href="#Fig_127">Fig. 127</a>, occurs in incredible abundance in the Sicilian caves.
It bears the same relation, in point of size, to the fossil
variety of the African hippopotamus, as the living <i class="taxonomy">H.
liberiensis</i> does to the latter.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_161"><i>Bone-caves of Malta.</i></h3>

<p>The bone-caves of Malta were first scientifically explored
by Admiral Spratt, in 1858, and subsequently by
Dr. Leith Adams, and others. The Maghlak Cave near
the town of Crendi, contained large quantities of the
<i class="taxonomy">Hippopotamus Pentlandi</i>, together with the gigantic
dormouse, named <i class="taxonomy">Myoxus Melitensis</i>. A short distance
off a second cavern, explored by Dr. Leith Adams, contained
numerous remains of at least two species of pigmy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">378</a></span>
elephant about the height of a small horse. Its small size
may be gathered from the accompanying woodcut (<a href="#Fig_128">Fig. 128</a>) of the last lower true molar, taken from the lithograph
published in Dr. Falconer’s “Palæontographical
Memoirs,” vol. ii. pl. xii.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_162"><i>Range of Pigmy Hippopotamus.</i></h3>

<p>The pigmy hippopotamus has lived also in other districts
in the Mediterranean region. One of its teeth,
now preserved in the British Museum, was discovered
by Dr. Leith Adams, in Candia. In 1872 I identified
in the Oxford Museum a last lower true molar, which
extends the range of this species to the mainland of
Europe. It was obtained by Dr. Rolleston from a
Greek tomb at Megalopolis, in the Peloponese, and was
probably derived from one of the many caves in the
limestone of that district. For this extinct animal to
have spread from Sicily to Malta, from Malta to Candia,
and from Candia to the Peloponese, or vice versâ, these
three islands must have been united to the Peloponese
and have been the higher grounds of land, now submerged
beneath the waves of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The view therefore, advanced by Dr. Falconer and
Admiral Spratt, that Europe was connected with Africa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>
by a bridge of land, extending northwards from Sicily,
is fully borne out by an examination of the fossil
remains both of that island and of Malta (see <a href="#Fig_129">Fig. 129</a>).<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_163"><i>Fossil Mammalia in Algeria.</i></h3>

<p>If the African mainland extended to Europe in the
direction of the Straits of Gibraltar, and of Malta and
Sicily, so as to afford passage for the African mammalia
into Europe, it would equally afford passage for the
southern advance into Africa of some of the European
mammalia. Evidence of this we meet with in a stratum
of clay at Mansourah, near Constantine, in Algeria,
described by M. Bayle in 1854.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> The animals which he
obtained, consisting of the ox, antelope, hippopotamus,
and elephant, have been described by Prof. Gervais.
An examination of his figure of a fragment of a molar
tooth leaves no room for doubt, that the <i class="taxonomy">Elephas meridionalis</i>
was living in north Africa during the pleistocene
age; that is to say an extinct animal, the head-quarters
of which are to be found in Italy, ranged as far south
as northern Africa.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_164"><i>Living Species common to Europe and Africa.</i></h3>

<p>The former continuity of Africa by way of the Iberian
peninsula and Sicily, may also be inferred by the
distribution of the mammalia at the present time.
Prof. Gervais<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> observes that most of the insectivora are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">380</a></span>
the same in Europe and north Africa. The genette and
ferret (<i class="taxonomy">Fœtorius furo</i>), the <i class="taxonomy">Mangousta Widdringtoni</i>
(Gray), and the fallow deer, are common to Spain
and Africa. The porcupine of Algeria belongs to the
same species as that of Italy and Sicily, and the wild
boar does not present any characters of importance by
which it can be separated from that of Europe. From
the present range, therefore, of the mammalia the same
conclusion may be drawn as to the continuity of Africa
with Europe as is afforded by their distribution in the
pleistocene age.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_165"><i>Evidence of Soundings.</i></h3>

<p>These conclusions derived from the study of the
mammalia, are corroborated and supplemented by the
evidence of the soundings. As we enter the Straits of
Gibraltar (<a href="#Fig_129">Fig. 129</a>) the Atlantic Ocean shallows, until
between Tangiers and Tarifa it is not more than from
270 to 300 fathoms. Between Tarifa and Ceuta the
sea measures from 300 to 400 fathoms, and thence, in
passing eastwards, suddenly deepens to the extent of
over 1,500 fathoms. An elevation of 400 fathoms
would be quite sufficient to raise a barrier of land
between Morocco and Spain, and to insulate the deep
Mediterranean basin from the Atlantic. The soundings
between Sicily and Tunis are 260 fathoms; between the
former place and Malta, 55 fathoms; between Malta
and the African mainland, 34·4 fathoms. An elevation
of 400 fathoms would suffice therefore to connect Africa
with Sicily, and to insulate the eastern from the western
Mediterranean depths. To the east of Sicily the soundings
reveal a depth of over 2,000 fathoms, and this deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
basin extends as far to the east as Cyprus and Asia
Minor. Between Candia and the Peloponese, the sea is
460 fathoms deep. An elevation therefore from 400 to
500 fathoms would allow of the passage of <i class="taxonomy">Hippopotamus
Pentlandi</i> from Candia to the Peloponese, and
thence by southern Italy into Sicily and Malta. I have
therefore represented in the map what would be the
necessary result of the elevation of the bottom of the
Mediterranean to that extent. Two great barriers of
land would unite Africa with Spain and Italy, and
enable the African mammalia to find their way into
the regions north of the Mediterranean Sea. The
shallowness of the sea at those two points indicates the
existence of the sunken barriers. The African elephant
however did not pass far northwards, since it has only
been met with in Spain and Sicily.</p>

<div id="Fig_129" class="figcenter" style="width: 852px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 129.</span>&mdash;Physiography of Mediterranean in Pleistocene Age.</div></div>

<p>Such a change in level as this would convert the
Adriatic into dry land, and cause the islands of the
Grecian Archipelago to rise high above the surrounding
plains. The 500-fathom line is therefore taken to represent
the probable sea margin of the pleistocene age,
although in centres of volcanic activity, such as Sicily
and the Archipelago, local changes of level, even of
greater magnitude, may have taken place.</p>

<p>This view of the former elevation of the Mediterranean
area to a height of from two to three thousand feet above
the present level will go far to explain the remarkable
traces of glaciers discovered in Syria, Anatolia, and
Morocco.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_166"><i>The Glaciers of Lebanon.</i></h3>

<p>Dr. Hooker, in his journey to Syria in 1860, discovered
that the cedars of Lebanon grew principally on one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">383</a></span>
spot, on old moraines which traverse the head of the
Kedisha valley. This valley terminates in broad, shallow,
open basins at a height of about 6,000 feet above
the sea, resembling the corries of the Highlands; and
one of these, in which the cedars grew, was divided
into two distinct flats by a transverse range of ancient
moraines from 80 to 100 feet high and with perfectly
defined boundaries. “The rills from the surrounding
heights collect in the upper flat, and form one stream,
which winds among the moraines on its way down to
the lower flat, whence it is precipitated into the gorge of
the Kedisha. The cedars grow on that portion of the
moraine which immediately borders this stream, and
nowhere else; they form one group about 400 yards
in diameter, with an outstanding tree or two not
far from the rest, and appear as a black speck in the
great area of the corry and its moraines, which contain
no other arborious vegetation, nor any shrubs, but a few
berberry and rose bushes that form no feature in the
landscape.”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p>In ancient times, therefore, the glaciers descended to a
height of about 6,000 feet above the sea, and were fed
by the perennial snow-fields of the crest of Lebanon.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_167"><i>The Glaciers of Anatolia.</i></h3>

<p>The former presence of glaciers at nearly the same
altitude has also been proved by the travels of Mr.
Gifford Palgrave in Anatolia,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> especially in the valley
through which the Chorok flows, and in the mountainous
country to the north-east, between Georgia and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>
Black Sea. The river Chorok runs about 120 miles in
a north-easterly direction, and is separated from the
Euxine by a mountain chain reaching a height of 11,000
feet, thus forming a long strip of land, which is called
Lazistan after its inhabitants, a tribe of Lazes. It then
turns suddenly to the north, where it falls into the sea.
The southern side is determined by mountains of Cretaceous,
Jurassic, and Plutonic rocks, which form the
watershed between the tributaries of the Black Sea and
Persian Gulf. Three large moraines are to be found on
the southern side of the valley, their lower extremity
about 5,000, their upper origin nearly 8,000 feet above
the sea. No moraines are seen where the chain does
not reach an altitude of 7,000 feet, though angular
boulders are not uncommon. The upper mountain
contours are invariably rounded, and smoothed off, and
the sides are scooped too widely for the depressions to
have been caused by water. Low down in the valley
the slopes terminate in rifted precipices.</p>

<p>That these moraines were posterior to the volcanic
eruptions in the district, is evident from the examination
of a broad stone ridge, near the highest point to the east
of Erzeroum, where at a height of 7,000 feet the Jurassic
limestone was interrupted by a volcanic outbreak of
several miles in extent. Traces of a crater were visible.
Above, the granite peaks rose to a height of 9,000 feet;
below, a wide moraine crossed the road, composed of
volcanic fragments mixed with granite. Consequently,
it must have been formed after the volcano had become
extinct. Similar traces are to be found at Keskeem
Boughaz. Mr. Palgrave concludes “that the ice-cap of
the north-eastern Anatolian watershed, in post-pleiocene
(pleistocene) times, must have reached downwards, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">385</a></span>
the northern side of the range, to 7,000 feet above the
present sea-level, while some of the glaciers issuing from
it descended to about 4,500 of the same measurement.”
Striated and ice-worn boulders, especially of granite,
were very abundant. This region, it must be observed,
is within sight of the lofty granite range of Tortoom,
which is “streaked with perpetual snow.”</p>

<p>After leaving the Chorok valley and getting on to the
watershed, at a distance of fifty miles to the north-east, Mr.
Palgrave reached the main ridge or backbone of the land.
Here, among the limestone ledges, about 6,400 feet above
the sea, is a colossal moraine, formed of worn granite
blocks, partly overgrown with forest, and descending from
a height of over 8,000 feet. It is divided, by a valley,
from a lofty undulating granite plateau that is scooped
out here and there into deep oval lakes, always full of
blue water. The sides of the plateau are strewn with
boulders of granite, brought from the higher peaks about
five miles off. These boulders occur in greater or less
abundance down to the basin of the Ardahan, near the
sources of the Kur or Cyras, which joins the Araxes
before flowing into the Caspian. The height of this
Ardahan basin is about 6,500 feet; it is, but for a slight
easterly slope, a water level. The bottom consists of
deep alluvial soil mixed with detritus and boulders; the
sides are rounded and smoothed, and bear every mark of
long ice-covering. These plateaux, studded with lakes,
stretch east to Russo-Georgia, till their greatest height is
gained at Kel Dagh, a mountain about 11,000 feet high:
thence they descend to the plains of Georgia and the
Black Sea.</p>

<p>No glacial marks have been observed on the seaward
side of the range, except at Hamshun in the Lazistan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">386</a></span>
mountains, between the River Riom and Trebizond.
Here, at 6,900 feet, is a granite-strewn plateau, thinly
green with grass, sheltered from the sea by lofty peaks
on the north-west, and backed to the south-east by
tremendous jagged granite cliffs, the highest 12,500
feet above the sea. The plateau itself is about forty
miles in length, irregular in breadth, its surface rounded
and jotted over with boulders. But just as my track
led near under the base of Verehembek, at an altitude
of 8,300 feet, it crossed a large broad moraine, descending
from the higher slopes, and having its base in a broad
bare valley not far below, which showed that here, at
the highest and widest part of the Lazistan chain,
perpetual ice had once existed in sufficient quantity to
furnish at least one glacier. From this case it seems
that the limited ice-cap of the Hamshun highlands
extended no further down than 8,500 or 9,000 feet, thus
differing by a line of from 1,000 to 2,000 feet from the
glacial covering of the inland range.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_168"><i>The Glaciers of the Atlas Mountains.</i></h3>

<p>Similar traces of glaciers have been observed in the
Atlas mountains by Mr. George Maw,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> in his travels
in Morocco with Dr. Hooker and Mr. Ball in 1871.
“After four hours’ continued ascent,” he writes (p.&nbsp;19),
“the termination of the glen comes into full view, and
we observe with great interest that it is closed by a
group of moraines, proving the former existence of
glaciers in the Atlas, and confirming my opinion that
the great boulder beds flanking the chain are also of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">387</a></span>
glacial origin. Two villages, probably the highest in the
Atlas, are built on the principal moraine; Eitmasan, at
its base, at a height of 6,000 feet, and Arroond, near its
summit, at a height of 6,800 feet; the terminal angle of
the larger moraine having a vertical height of 800 feet.
It is composed of immense blocks of porphyry, lying
at a steep angle of repose, up which it takes us nearly
an hour to climb. The existence of these moraines in
latitude 30½° N. (the latitude of Alexandria) is perhaps
the most interesting fact we noticed during our journey,
for this is the most southerly point at which the evidence
of extinct glaciers has been observed, and tends to confirm
the opinion entertained by many geologists, that
the refrigeration during the glacial period was almost
Universal.”</p>

<h3 id="hdr_169"><i>Glaciers probably the result of elevation above the Sea.</i></h3>

<p>The elevation of the African moraines above the sea,
of about 6,000 feet and upwards, is nearly the same as
those of Asia Minor. If the mountains of the Atlas,
Lazistan, and Lebanon shared in the upward movement
of the Mediterranean area, the addition of 3,000 feet to
the height could not fail to leave marks behind of the
low temperature thereby caused. It is very probable,
that during the time the Mediterranean was reduced to
two land-locked seas, these mountains were covered with
snow-fields, and constituted the ice-sheds of glaciers.</p>

<p>From the range of the mammalia we have inferred the
existence of land barriers, extending across from Africa
to Spain and Italy, and from Candia to Greece, and their
actual existence beneath the sea has been proved by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">388</a></span>
soundings, which necessitate an elevation of from 400
to 500 fathoms to bring them above the sea-level. We
have also seen that the higher mountains, which most
probably participated in this upward movement, bear
traces of a lower temperature in the moraines of the
Atlas and Lazistan. The hypothesis of such an elevation
during the pleistocene age may therefore be taken to be
proved so far as it explains two widely different classes of
facts, the distribution of the mammals and the existence
of glaciers where they are now unknown.</p>

<p>The physical condition of the Mediterranean area, in
the pleistocene age, may be summed up as follows. The
mainland of Africa extended northwards to join Europe,
in the direction of Gibraltar and Italy. The islands of
Malta and Sicily were hilly plateaux, overlooking an
undulatory plain. Corsica and Sardinia were joined to
Italy, Majorca and Minorca to Spain, Candia to Peloponese,
and Cyprus to Asia Minor. The area now occupied
by the Adriatic Sea constituted the lower valley of the
Po, and the Archipelago was a plain studded with
volcanic cones; and at the same time glaciers crowned the
higher mountains of northern Africa and of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The substitution of land for a stretch of sea, in the
Mediterranean, could not fail to cause the summer heat
to be more intense in the region to the north than at
the present time, while the increased elevation would
produce a greater severity of winter cold, as Mr. Godwin
Austen has pointed out in the case of the hills of
Devonshire. When, indeed, we consider that the pleistocene
land surface extended from the snowy heights
of Atlas, as far north as the 100-fathom line off the
coast of Ireland, we might expect to find African animals,
such as the spotted hyæna and <i class="taxonomy">Felis caffer</i>, ranging as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">389</a></span>
far north as Yorkshire, for the only barrier to their
migration would be that offered by the severity of
a pleistocene winter.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_170"><i>Mediterranean Coast-line comparatively modern.</i></h3>

<p>The submergence of the barriers, and the constitution
of the Mediterranean as we find it now, have probably
taken place but a short time ago, from the geological
point of view, though we know that for the last
3,000 years the coast-line has been on the whole
unchanged, except from the silting out of the sea by the
sediment of rivers, such as the Po, and the elevation
and depression of small areas by volcanic energy, as at
Santorin. The physical character of the shores testifies
to the truth of this view.</p>

<p>“On entering the Straits of Gibraltar,” Mr. Maw
writes, “from the Atlantic, a notable change takes place
in the aspect of the coast. Cape St. Vincent, on the
Atlantic coast, presents a bold line of cliffs to the sea,
and bluff cliffs extend many miles towards the Straits;
but as soon as these are passed, a change of coast-form
takes place, which must be noticeable to every observer.
Cliffs on the sea-board become the exception, and the
general line of the coast is merely a shelving under the
sea of the general hill-and-valley system of the land, the
sea running up all the depressions, and the land elevations
spreading out into the sea with scarcely any abrupt
cliff-line of demarcation. The uneven sea-bottom of the
Straits seems to be a continuation of the contour of the
adjacent land, consisting of rolling alternations of hill
and valley, which must have received its conformation
by subaerial agencies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">390</a></span>
“Corsica, and the adjacent islands of Elba, Capraja,
and Monte Christo, are also remarkable for the absence
of cliffs, and are wanting in those abrupt escarpements
separating land and water which are so abundant on our
own coasts. Their aspect is that of mountain-tops
rising out of the sea, suggesting to the eye the seaward
prolongation of their subaerial contour of sloping hillsides
and river-cut valleys, as though the sea had not
stood sufficiently long at its present level to excavate an
escarpement. The deep intersecting bays that occur along
the coast from Marseilles to the Riviera suggest the
same conclusion, the undulating land surface spreading
down to the water’s edge, and the deep bays running up
the intervening valleys, which must have had an origin
common with that of their landward prolongations.”</p>

<p>It is impossible to shut our eyes to the full force of
this reasoning. The present aspect of the Mediterranean
is, geologically speaking, a thing of yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_171"><i>Changes of Level in the Sahara coincident with those
in the Mediterranean.</i></h3>

<p>But if the Mediterranean area has been depressed to an
amount of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet since the pleistocene
age, we have proof that the region to the south has been
elevated to that extent in comparatively modern times.
Mr. Maw,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> in his journey in 1873 to the Northern
Sahara, observed raised beaches at a height of 2,000 feet,
and loam and shingle-beds as high as 2,700 feet. He
therefore concludes that the part of the Sahara which he
explored had been raised at least 3,000 feet above the
sea. These changes of level, the same in amount, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span>
in opposite directions, were probably compensatory and
simultaneous. Northern Africa may have been cut off
from the central and southern portions of the continent
by the sea extending over the Sahara, during the time
that the Mediterranean was represented by the two inland
salt lakes figured in the accompanying map (<a href="#Fig_129">Fig. 129</a>). And while the region of the Sahara was being
elevated, that of the Mediterranean was probably being
depressed.</p>

<p>These changes in the relation of sea to land, and the
greater elevation of the mountains in the neighbouring
countries, must have affected not merely the climate of
southern, but also of north-western Europe, and ought
not to be left out of account in any theory relating to
pleistocene climate.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_172"><i>The Evidence of the Mammalia as to Climate.</i></h3>

<p class="in0">In the last three chapters we have seen that the
cave-mammalia throw great light on the pleistocene
geography of Europe, and that there is reason for the
belief that the land surface then extended northwards
and westwards, so as to include Ireland; and southwards
to join Africa, in the direction of Sicily, Malta, and
Gibraltar. We must now pass on to the consideration
of the climate on this great continental area, which
would allow of so large and varied a fauna existing in
our quarter of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">393</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_173"><i>The Southern Group of Animals.</i></h3>

<p>The pleistocene fauna is remarkable for the mixture
of species. It consists of forms now banished to South
Africa, Northern Asia, and America, or to the severe
climate of high mountains, mingled with those which
lived in Europe in the historic age, and those which have
wholly disappeared from the face of the earth. We will
take the living species first.</p>

<p>The southern group consists of the following <span class="locked">animals:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0 in4">
Lion.<br />
Caffir Cat.<br />
Spotted Hyæna.<br />
Striped Hyæna.<br />
Serval.<br />
Hippopotamus.<br />
African Elephant.<br />
Porcupine.
</p>

<p>At the present day the lion ranges over the whole of
Africa, with the exception of Egypt and the Cape
Colony, whence it has been driven out by the hand of
man. In Asia, the maneless variety inhabits the valley
of the Tigris and Euphrates, and the districts bordering
on the Persian Gulf; and in India, according to Mr.
Blyth, the province of Kattywar in Guzerat. Although
now only found in these hot regions, it is proved,
by the concurrent testimony of Herodotus, Aristotle,
Xenophon, Ælian, and Pausanias, to have inhabited the
mountains of Thrace, and of Asia Minor, and it probably
became extinct in Europe before the end of the first
century after Christ.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> We may therefore infer that it
possessed a sufficient elasticity of constitution to endure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">394</a></span>
a considerable degree of cold, although its present distribution
implies that it is better fitted to thrive in a
tropical than in a cold climate. The Caffir cat (<i class="taxonomy">Felis
caffer</i> of Desmarest) is an African species, which has
been discovered by Mr. Ayshford Sanford and myself,
in Somersetshire; it also occurs in the caves of Germany,
France, and Gibraltar. The spotted hyæna now
lives only in South Africa, while the striped species
ranges through Africa and the warmer regions of Asia.
It was extremely rare in Europe in the pleistocene age,
and has not been identified in any deposit further north
than Lunelviel, in southern France. The hippopotamus,
now found only in middle and southern Africa, is proved
by its fossil remains to have formerly dwelt in the region
of the Lower Nile, as well as in Algeria. The serval and
African elephant have been found in the Iberian peninsula,
and the latter in Sicily.</p>

<p>The evidence afforded by the animals, as to the pleistocene
climate of those portions of Europe which they
inhabited, differs considerably in point of value, but on
the whole indicates that it was temperate, or comparatively
hot; for although the elasticity of constitution
which we know to have been possessed by the lion, was
probably shared by the spotted hyæna, it is very
unlikely that so aquatic an animal as the hippopotamus
could have ranged from southern Europe, as far north as
Yorkshire, under any other than temperate conditions.
It could not have endured a winter sufficiently severe
to cover the rivers with a thick coating of ice, without
having its present habits profoundly modified; and
such an alteration of habits would certainly leave its
mark, in other modifications in the fossil skeleton than
those minute differences which have been observed, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">395</a></span>
it is compared with that of the living <i class="taxonomy">Hippopotamus
amphibius</i>. The porcupine of southern Europe has been
found as far north as the caves of Belgium (Schmerling).</p>

<h3 id="hdr_174"><i>The Northern Group.</i></h3>

<p>The northern group consists of those animals which
are now only to be met with in the colder regions of the
northern hemisphere, either in low latitudes or at great
altitudes.</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
Marmot.<br />
Pouched Marmot.<br />
Lemming.<br />
Alpine Hare.<br />
Tailless Hare.<br />
Glutton.<br />
Arctic Fox.<br />
Musk-sheep.<br />
Reindeer.<br />
Ibex.<br />
Chamois.
</p>

<p>To this list the palæolithic man of the caves must be
added, since he is probably related by blood to the
Eskimos, and appeared in Europe simultaneously with
the arctic group of animals.</p>

<p>The testimony of these animals as to climate is directly
opposed to that of the preceding group, since they
now only flourish in the arctic regions, or in mountainous
districts in which the climate is severe. The
marmot, in the pleistocene age, lived in Belgium, and
descended from the Alpine heights as far as the shores of
the Mediterranean, where it has been met with in the
caverns near Nice. The pouched marmot, <i class="taxonomy">Spermophilus
citillus</i> of the Don and Volga, penetrated as far to the
west as Somersetshire. The Alpine hare, now found
only in the colder climates of northern Europe, Asia, and
America (with the solitary exception of Ireland), ranged
as far down the valley of the Rhine as Schussenreid, in
Suabia. The two carnivores now dwelling in the colder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">396</a></span>
regions of the north, the glutton or wolverine, and the
arctic fox, have been discovered, the one as far south as
France, the other as far as Schussenreid, and both
probably occupied the whole of Germany, and of northern
Russia, in the pleistocene age.</p>

<p>The musk-sheep,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> the most arctic in its habit of all
the herbivores, is, at the present time, restricted to the
high latitudes of North America, where it thrives in the
desolate, treeless, barren grounds, not even being driven
from its haunts by the extreme severity of the winter.
It has been traced, by its fossil remains, from its present
abode, across Behring’s Straits, and through the vast
Siberian steppes, into Russia in Europe, Germany,
Britain, and as far south and west as the barrier offered
by the Pyrenees. Throughout this large area its remains
occur in association with the reindeer, and both these
animals, as I have remarked above, were hunted by the
palæolithic dwellers in the caves of Aquitaine, just as
they are now hunted by the Eskimos on the shores of the
Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>If the present habits of these animals be any index
to their mode of life in the pleistocene age, their presence
in the area north of the Alps and Pyrenees implies
that the climate in France, Germany, and Britain was
severe, or analogous to that which they now enjoy on
the tops of lofty mountains, or in the northern Asiatic
steppes, or the high northern latitudes of America. But
this conclusion is diametrically opposed to that which
is based on the evidence of the southern group of animals.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">397</a></span><a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>
And the remains of the two groups of animals are so
associated together in the caves, and river-deposits of
Europe, north of the Pyrenees, that it is impossible to
deny the fact that it was the common feeding-ground
of both during the same era.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr_175"><i>Probable Cause of Association of Northern and Southern Groups.</i></h3>

<p>Must we then infer that in the pleistocene age the
present habits of the musk-sheep, the reindeer, chamois,
or ibex, were so changed as to allow them to flourish
side by side with the hippopotamus, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versâ</i>? Was
the climate colder than it is now in Europe, or was it
hotter? How was this singular association of northern
and southern species brought about? The problem may
be solved if we refer to the present distribution of animals
in northern Asia and North America. As the
winter comes on the arctic species gradually retreat
southwards, and occupy the summer feeding-grounds of
the elk, red-deer, and other creatures which are unable
to endure the extreme severity of an arctic winter. In
the spring the latter pass northwards, to enjoy the
summer herbage of that area, which had been the winter-quarters
of the arctic group of animals. Thus there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">398</a></span>
is a continued swinging to and fro, over the same region,
of the arctic and the temperate animals, and their remains
must necessarily become more or less associated in the
river-deposits, as well as in caves, where these last happen
to occur. In northern Asia, and in America, the only
boundary between the northern and temperate zoological
provinces is that constituted by the fluctuating annual
temperature, and there are no great hilly barriers
running east and west, to prevent free migration to the
north or south. If reference be made to the map, <a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>, it will be seen that these conditions were amply
satisfied in the pleistocene age. There were no physical
barriers to migration, from the shores of the Mediterranean,
as far north as Ireland. If the winter cold were
severe, the reindeer and musk-sheep might advance as
far south as the Pyrenees, and if the summer heat were
intense there would be nothing to forbid the hippopotamus
and the African carnivores advancing northwards.
It seems to me that this is the only hypothesis which
will satisfy all the facts of the case. The traces of
glaciers and snow-fields where they are no longer found
prove that the winter was severe; while the warmth of
the summer seems to be sufficiently demonstrated by
the presence of African species. Such extremes of temperature
are presented, more or less, by all continents
extending from high to low latitudes. They are modified
in Europe at the present time by the warm current of
the Gulf Stream, by the large area now occupied by the
Mediterranean Sea, and by the submergence of the pleistocene
lowlands on the Atlantic border.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">399</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_176"><i>The Temperate Group.</i></h3>

<p>The third group of pleistocene mammalia consists of
those still living in the temperate zones of Europe, Asia,
and America:</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
Beaver.<br />
Hare.<br />
Rabbit.<br />
Wild Cat.<br />
Martin.<br />
Stoat.<br />
Weasel.<br />
Otter.<br />
Brown Bear.<br />
Grizzly Bear.<br />
Wolf.<br />
Fox.<br />
Horse.<br />
Urus.<br />
Bison.<br />
<i class="taxonomy">Antelope saiga.</i><br />
Wild Boar.<br />
Stag.<br />
Roe.
</p>

<p>The range of many of these animals has been profoundly
modified since the pleistocene age. The <i class="taxonomy">Antelope
saiga</i> of the Don and Volga lived as far to the
west as Aquitaine. The grizzly bear, instead of being
restricted to its American habitat in the Rocky Mountains,
ranged over the whole of Siberia into Europe, as
far to the south as the Mediterranean, and westwards as
far as Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The urus<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> still lives in the larger domestic cattle, and
the bison is represented in Europe by those which are
protected by the forest laws of Lithuania, and in North
America by the vast herds which are rapidly being
exterminated, like the red Indian, by the rifles of the
settlers. The horse was as abundant, and as widely
spread over Europe, as the urus and the bison; according
to Prof. Brandt it now no longer lives in Siberia
in a wild state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">400</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hdr_177"><i>Species common to Cold and Tropical Climates.</i></h3>

<p>The panther or leopard, which has been found alike
in Britain, France, and Germany, has at the present
day a most extended range through Africa, from Barbary
to the Cape of Good Hope, and throughout Persia into
Siberia. In this latter country Dr. Gothelf Fischer
describes it as living in the same districts in the Altai
Mountains, and in Soongaria, as the tiger. The fox
and wolf are like instances of carnivores being able to
endure great variations in temperature without being
specifically modified. These three animals, therefore,
tell us nothing as to the pleistocene climate.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_178"><i>Extinct Species.</i></h3>

<p>The extinct pleistocene species may also be divided
into the same classes as the living, by an appeal to their
geographical distribution. Two out of the three species
of rhinoceros found in the caves (<i class="taxonomy">R. megarhinus</i> and <i class="taxonomy">R.
hemitœchus</i>), and an elephant with slightly curved tusks
(<i class="taxonomy">E. antiquus</i>), had their head-quarters south of the Alps
and Pyrenees, whence they wandered northward as far
as the latitude of Yorkshire. The pigmy elephant and
the dwarf hippopotamus are peculiar to the south, and
the <i class="taxonomy">Machairodus latidens</i>, or large sabre-toothed felis,
is a survival, from the pleiocene age, of a peculiarly
southern type.</p>

<p>The woolly rhinoceros, on the other hand, may be
viewed as a northern form, since it is met with in vast
abundance in the arctic regions of Siberia, as well as in
Europe, and has not been found south of the Alps and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">401</a></span>
Pyrenees. The cave-bear has not been discovered either
in the extreme north or in the south of Europe, and
may therefore be considered of temperate range; and the
Irish elk, identified by Prof. Brandt, from the caves of
the Altai Mountains, had a similar range in middle
Europe. The mammoth, endowed with an elastic constitution,
was able to endure the severity of an arctic
climate in Siberia and North America, and the temperature
of the latitude of Rome and the Gulf of
Mexico,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> and consequently tells us as little of the pleistocene
climate as the panther, fox, or wolf.</p>

<p>The evidence, therefore, as to climate, offered by the
extinct animals in the caves is of the same nature as
that of the living. There is the same mixture of northern
and southern forms, which can only be accounted for
satisfactorily by seasonal migrations, according to the
summer heat and winter cold, such as those which are
now observed to take place in Siberia and North America.</p>

<p>Before we consider the relation of the pleistocene
animals buried in the caves and river deposits to the
glacial period, it is necessary to define what is meant by
the term glacial.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_179"><i>Two Periods of Glaciation in Britain.</i></h3>

<p>At the close of the pleistocene period the climate
gradually became colder, until ultimately it was arctic in
severity in northern Europe. The researches of many
eminent observers prove that an enormous sheet of ice,
like that under which Greenland now lies buried, extended
over North Britain, Wales, and Ireland, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">402</a></span>
its mark in the far-travelled blocks of stone, the moraines,
and the grooves which pass over the surface irrespective
of the minor contours. The land then, most probably,
as Prof. Ramsay and Sir Charles Lyell believe, stood
higher than it does now. To this succeeded a period of
depression, during which the mountains of Wales were
submerged to a height of at least 1,300 feet; and the
waves of the sea washed out of the pre-existing glacial
detritus the shingle and sand, termed the “middle drift,”
which occurs also in Scotland and Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> Then the
land was re-elevated above the waves, and a second
period of glaciers set in, traces of which occur abundantly
in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, in the white areas in
<a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>. They were, however, of far less extent than
those which preceded them, occupying isolated areas
instead of forming one continuous icy covering to the
country. The glacial phenomena may be briefly summed
up as follows: 1. As the pleiocene temperature was
lowered, the glaciers crept down from the tops of the
mountains, until at last they united to form one continuous
ice sheet, moving resistlessly over the smaller
hills and valleys to the lower grounds, and the first
ice or glacial period set in. 2. Then followed the era
of depression beneath the sea. 3. And, lastly, on the
land re-emerging from the sea the second ice or glacial
period began. The climate during the marine depression
must obviously have been milder than that of either of
the glacial periods, because of the moderating effect of
the wide extent of sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">403</a></span>
The exact relation of the boulder clays with marine
shells, in the centre and south of Britain, to the detritus
left behind by the ice-sheet in the north, has not as yet
been satisfactorily ascertained. It is very probable that
the elevation of land in the north was simultaneous with
a southern depression, which allowed of icebergs depositing
their burdens in the eastern counties, in the valley
of the Thames, and as far south as Selsea, on the coast
of Sussex.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_180"><i>Three Climatal Changes represented on the Continent.</i></h3>

<p>These changes of climate have also been observed
on the continent of Europe. The Swiss geologists
have shown that the Alpine glaciers extended farther
than they do at the present time, and that they present
two stages of extension, the first of which is of
greater magnitude than the second. The Alpine blocks
and moraines have been traced far down into the plains
of Lombardy, northwards into the valley of the Rhine,
and in France as far south in the valley of the Rhone as
Valence. The admirable essay and map brought by
MM. Falsan and Chantre, before the meeting of the
French Association for the Advancement of Science at
Lyons, in 1873, show that there were two periods of
glaciation in the valley of the Rhone, the one being due
to the movement of an ice-sheet irrespective of the lower
hills, the other being merely the work of the glaciers
localized in the valleys. These in all probability correspond
in point of time with the like stages of the complicated
glacial phenomena in Britain. At this time the
glaciers of the Pyrenees, now so small, extended at
least from thirty to forty miles from their present position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">404</a></span>
down into the plains, leaving behind most astounding
evidences of their presence in the valley of the
Garonne and elsewhere. On the Spanish frontier, for
example, one of the precipitous sides of the valley, near
the Pont du Roy, is so smoothed and polished that it is
bare of vegetation except in the deep grooves, which offer
a precarious support to the roots of ferns and of dwarf
beeches. The hills of Dauphiny also and Auvergne were
crowned with glaciers, and those of the latter have
been shown by MM. Falsan and Chantre to have been
conterminous with those of the Alps.</p>

<p>The interglacial period of marine depression in Britain
is represented in Switzerland by the lignite beds of
Dürnten, Utznach, and Pfaffikon, the last of which rests
upon and is covered by the boulder drift. The fossil
remains from Dürnten, identified by Dr. Falconer and
Prof. Rütimeyer, prove that two southern animals, <i class="taxonomy">Elephas
antiquus</i> and <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros megarhinus</i>, inhabited the
district in the interval between the retreat of one set of
glaciers and the advance of another. They probably
migrated from the plains of Lombardy, where they
abounded in the pleistocene age.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_181"><i>Europe invaded by Pleistocene Mammals before the Glacial Period.</i></h3>

<p>What is the precise relation of the pleistocene mammals
to these two periods of cold? Did they invade
northern and central Europe during the first or the
second, before or after, the marine submergence indicated
by the “middle drift?” We might expect, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i>,
that as the temperature became lowered, the northern
mammalia would gradually invade the region occupied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">405</a></span>
before by the pleiocene forms, and that the reindeer,
the mammoth, and woolly rhinoceros would gradually
supplant the southern <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros Etruscus</i> and <i class="taxonomy">Elephas
meridionalis</i>. Traces of such an occupation would
necessarily be very rare, since they would be exposed
to the grinding action both of the advancing glacial
sheet, and subsequently to that of the waves on the
littoral zone during the depression and re-elevation
of the land. At the time also that the greater part
of Great Britain was buried under an ice-sheet, it could
not have been occupied by animals, although they may
have been, and most probably were, living in the districts
farther to the south, which were not covered by ice. The
labours, however, of Dr. Bryce, Prof. Archibald Geikie,
and others prove that one at least of the characteristic
pleistocene mammalia&mdash;the mammoth&mdash;lived in Scotland
along with the reindeer before the deposit of the
lower boulder-clay; while Mr. Jamieson has pointed
out that it could not have occupied that area at the
same time as the ice, and therefore must be referred to
a still earlier date.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> The teeth and bones discovered in
the ancient land surface at Selsea, under the boulder drift,
also very probably indicate that the mammoth lived in
Sussex before the glacial submergence, although they
were never admitted by Dr. Falconer to be of the same
age as the remains of <i class="taxonomy">Elephas antiquus</i> from the same
preglacial horizon. The animal also occurs in the preglacial
forest-bed of Norfolk and Suffolk. On a careful
examination of the whole evidence, I am compelled to
believe, with Mr. Godwin-Austen and Prof. Phillips,
that the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i> belief that the pleistocene mammalia
occupied Great Britain before the period of the ice-sheet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">406</a></span>
and submergence is fully borne out by the few incontestable
proofs that have been brought forward of the
remains being found in preglacial deposits. And the
scanty evidence on the point is just what might be
expected from the rare accidents under which the bones
in superficial deposits could have withstood the grinding
of the ice-sheet, and the subsequent erosive action
of the waves on the coast-line. It may therefore be
concluded, that the pleistocene mammalia arrived in
Europe before the temperature had reached its minimum
in the glacial period. On the other hand, the occurrence
of mammaliferous river strata, either in hollows of the
boulder-clay as at Hoxne, or in valleys excavated after
its deposition as at Bedford, prove that the characteristic
animals occupied Britain after the retreat of the ice-sheet,
and after the re-emergence of the land from
beneath the glacial sea.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_182"><i>Mammalia lived in Britain during the Second Ice or Glacial Period.</i></h3>

<p>The distribution of the animals in the river deposits
gives us a clue to the physical geography during
the second ice period. In an essay read before the
Geological Society in 1869, and in a second printed in
the “Popular Science Review” in 1872, I showed that
there was a singular irregularity in the contents of the
river strata, and that while the fossil mammalia
were abundant throughout the area (marked with dots
in the map, <a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>), there were certain districts in
which they had not been met with. One of these barren
areas comprises (plain in the map, <a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>), nearly the
whole of Wales. A second includes a large portion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">407</a></span>
Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and
the whole of Scotland (if the preglacial mammals in the
low district between the Frith of Forth and Frith of
Clyde in the map be omitted), and a third is represented
by nearly the whole of Ireland. These areas are remarkable
for the absence of the mammalia from the
river deposits. They are also characterised by the freshness
of the ice marks which they present. Nearly every
valley has its own system of grooves and its own set
of moraines; and the mounds of clay and marl left
behind by the local glacier, as it slowly retreated to
higher levels till it finally disappeared, are to be
observed in great abundance. If we bring these facts
into relation, the barrenness of the areas may be reasonably
explained by the presence of glaciers, <em>while</em> the
pleistocene mammals were living in the south and east
(see map, <a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>). A barrier of some kind may
reasonably be inferred to have prevented their range
over those districts, and its nature is indicated by the
ice marks. It is very probable that these glaciers had
not passed away before the close of the pleistocene age:
for in that case the characteristic animals would be discovered
in the river gravels, which are later than the
deposits of local glaciers in those districts.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_183"><i>The Glacial Period does not separate one Life-era from another.</i></h3>

<p>The lowering of the temperature which culminated in
the glacial period has left palpable traces behind in the
changes which it caused in the European fauna. As the
pleiocene climate became colder, the animals unfitted to
endure the cold, such as the deer of the Indian types of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">408</a></span>
Axis and Rusa, either migrated to the south or became
extinct, while their feeding-grounds were invaded by
the dwellers in the temperate zone, the stag, roe, bison,
and other animals. These in their turn were pushed
forward by the arctic group of animals, the musk-sheep,
lemming, reindeer, and others, the progress being
in the main steadily to the south while the cold was
increasing, and the retreat being steadily to the north
while it was decreasing. It will follow from this, that
the same district in central or north-western Europe
would be traversed by these migratory bodies of animals,
both in their southern advance in preglacial and glacial
times and their northern retreat in postglacial times,
and that, therefore, their fossil remains cannot afford a
means of fixing the preglacial, glacial, or postglacial,
age of the deposit in which they are found, where it is
not marked by traces of glaciation. Sir Charles Lyell’s
view, that the glacial period cannot be taken as a landmark
in the classification of the European pleistocene
deposits, is fully borne out by the facts, and still less
can it be taken as a hard and fast line between one fauna
and another. It cannot be considered a life-era like
the eocene, meiocene, pleiocene, or prehistoric divisions
of the tertiary period.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_184"><i>Bone-caves inhabited before and after Ice Period.</i></h3>

<p>If we allow that the lowering of the temperature was
the principal cause of the presence of temperate and
arctic animals, in a region before inhabited by species
fitted to live in a comparatively warm climate, it will
follow that bone-caves cannot be said to be either pre- or
postglacial, by an appeal to their fossil mammalia. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">409</a></span>
they were open before the minimum of temperature was
reached, they would afford shelter to the animals then
in the neighbourhood, and they would continue to be
occupied in the south during the vast period of time
represented by the enormous physical changes in the
region north of the line of the Thames, during the
development of the ice-sheet, the submergence and the
re-elevation of nearly the whole of Britain and Ireland.
As, however, the cold increased, the percentage of arctic
animals would also increase, and the more temperate
species be weeded out. For these reasons it has seemed
to me, that the machairodus of Kent’s Hole, and the
<i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros megarhinus</i> of Oreston, represent an early
stage of the pleistocene period, before the arctic mammalia
were present in full force in the caves. It is very
probable that vast herds of reindeer lived in the south
of France, while northern Britain lay buried under the
ice-sheet, as well as during the two succeeding physical
changes.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_185"><i>Relation of Palæolithic Man to Glacial Period.</i></h3>

<p>What then is the relation of the palæolithic hunter
of reindeer in France and Britain to the glacial period?
Is he pre- or postglacial? The only evidence on the
point is that offered by the associated mammalia which
occupied France, Germany, and Britain before and after
the point of minimum temperature was reached in these
latitudes. Man may have inhabited the caves not
merely of France, but of Devonshire and Somerset, at
any time during that long period. The position of the
palæolithic refuse-heap discovered by Prof. Fraas at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">410</a></span>
Schussenreid, resting on a moraine of the extinct glacier
of the Rhine, proves that the palæolithic Eskimos lived
in Suabia after the retreat of the glacier when the temperature
became warmer, towards the close of the
pleistocene age or in the later glacial stage. The same
conclusion has been arrived at by Mr. Prestwich as to
the sojourn of palæolithic man (of the river-bed type)
in Bedfordshire and Suffolk, the gravels in which the
implements are found being of a later age than the
boulder-clay of those districts. We have therefore
proof that man lived in Germany and Britain after the
maximum glacial cold had passed away, and we may
also infer with a high degree of probability that he
migrated into Europe along with the pleistocene mammalia
in the preglacial age.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_186"><i>Test of age of contents of caves in Glaciated Districts.</i></h3>

<p>The probable date of the introduction of the contents
into ossiferous caves in glaciated areas may be ascertained
by an examination of the river deposits. If the
animals found in the caves inhabited the surrounding
country after the melting of the ice, their remains will
occur in the postglacial gravels. If they are not found,
it may be inferred that they had retreated from the district,
before the latter were deposited. It is obvious
that they could not have lived in any district while it
was covered with ice or by the sea. It may therefore
be concluded that their remains in the caves were most
probably introduced before the glacial conditions had
set in. Preglacial deposits in a cavern would be protected
from the grinding of the ice-sheet, the action of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">411</a></span>
the waves in the depression, and re-elevation of the
land, and the subsequent glacial erosion which would
inevitably destroy nearly all the fluviatile ossiferous
strata. By this test the pleistocene strata in the Victoria
Cave, near Settle, may be considered preglacial, as
well as the hyæna-den at Kirkdale, which has always
been referred by Prof. Phillips to that age. If this
be allowed, the small fragment of human bone found
by the Settle Cave Exploration Committee in the
former cave in 1872 establishes the fact that man lived
in Yorkshire before the glacial period. The man to
whom it belonged was probably devoured by the hyænas
which dragged into their den the woolly rhinoceros,
reindeer, and other creatures whose gnawed bones were
strewn on the floors.</p>

<p class="in0">The animals inhabiting the caves have been enumerated
in the last three chapters, and we have discussed the
inferences drawn from their distribution as to the pleistocene
climate and geography of Europe. It remains for
us now, in conclusion, to define the pleistocene, and to
see in what relation it stands to the pleiocene period.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_187"><i>Classification of Pleistocene Strata by means of the Mammalia.</i></h3>

<p>The pleistocene period was one of very long duration,
and embraced changes of great magnitude in the geography
of Europe, as we have seen in the <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">ninth</a> and
<a href="#CHAPTER_X">tenth</a> chapters. The climate, which in the preceding
pleiocene age had been temperate in northern and middle
Europe, at the beginning of the pleistocene gradually
passed into the extreme arctic severity of the glacial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">413</a></span>
period. This change caused a corresponding change
of the forms of animal life; the pleiocene species, whose
constitutions were adjusted to temperate or hot climates,
yielding place to those which were better adapted to the
new conditions. And since there is reason for the belief
that it was not continuous in one direction, but that
there were pauses or even reversions towards the old
temperate state, it follows that the two groups of animals
would at times overlap, and their remains be intermingled
with each other. The frontiers also of each of the geographical
provinces must naturally have varied with the
season; and the competition for the same feeding-grounds
between the invading and retreating forms must have
been long, fluctuating, and severe. The passage, therefore,
from the pleiocene to the pleistocene fauna might
be expected to have been extremely gradual in each
area. The lines of definition between the two are to a
great extent arbitrary, instead of being marked with
sufficient strength to constitute a barrier between the
tertiary and post-tertiary groups of life of Lyell, or
between the tertiary and quaternary of French geologists.
The principle of classification which I have proposed<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> is
that offered by the gradual lowering of the temperature,
which has left its mark in the advent of animals before
unknown in Europe; and according to it I have divided
the pleistocene deposits into three groups.</p>

<p>1. Those in which the pleistocene immigrants had
begun to disturb the pleiocene mammalia, but had not
yet supplanted the more southern animals. No arctic
mammalia had as yet arrived. To this group belongs
the forest-bed of Norfolk and Suffolk, and the deposit
at St. Prest, near Chartres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">414</a></span>
2. That in which the characteristic pleiocene deer had
disappeared. The even-toed ruminants are principally
represented by the stag, the Irish elk, the roe, bison, and
urus. <i class="taxonomy">Elephas meridionalis</i> and <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros etruscus</i>
had retreated to the south. To this group belong the
brick-earths of the lower valley of the Thames, the river-deposit
at Clacton, the cave of Baume in the Jura, and
a river-deposit in Auvergne.</p>

<p>3. The third division is that in which the true arctic
mammalia were among the chief inhabitants of the
region; and to it belong most of the ossiferous caves
and river-deposits in middle and northern Europe.</p>

<p>These three do not correspond with the preglacial,
glacial, and postglacial divisions of the pleistocene strata,
in central and north Britain; since there is reason to
believe that all the animals which occupied Britain after
the maximum cold had passed away, had arrived here
in their southern advance before that maximum cold had
been reached; or, in other words, were both pre- and
postglacial.</p>

<p>This classification does not apply to pleistocene river-strata
south of the Alps and Pyrenees, into which the
arctic mammalia never penetrated.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_188"><i>The Late Pleistocene Division.</i></h3>

<p>The late pleistocene division corresponds in part with
the reindeer period of M. Lartet; but it comprehends
also his other three periods; for the spotted hyæna, the
lion, the cave-bear, the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros,
the bison, the reindeer, and the urus are so associated
together in the caves and river deposits of Great Britain
and the continent that they do not afford a means of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">415</a></span>
classification. The arctic division of the mammalia, defined
in the preceding chapter, was then in full possession
of the area north of the Alps and Pyrenees, and the
<i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros megarhinus</i> and <i class="taxonomy">Elephas meridionalis</i> had
disappeared. With three exceptions, to be noticed presently,
all the ossiferous caverns of France, Germany,
and Britain, belong to this division of the pleistocene.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_189"><i>The Middle Pleistocene Division.</i></h3>

<p>The middle division of the pleistocene mammalia may
now be examined, or that from which the characteristic
pleiocene deer had vanished, and were replaced by the
invading forms from the temperate zones of northern
Asia. It is represented in Britain by the mammalia
obtained from the lower brick-earths of the Thames
valley, at Crayford, Erith, Ilford, and Gray’s Thurrock,
by those from the deposit at Clacton, and most probably
by those of the older deposit in Kent’s Hole, and by the
<i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros megarhinus</i> of Oreston.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> They consist <span class="locked">of&mdash;</span></p>

The discovery of a flint-flake in the undisturbed lower
brick-earths of Crayford, by the Rev. O. Fisher, in the
presence of the writer, in April 1872, proves that man
was living while these fluviatile strata were being deposited.</p>

<p>If these mammalia be compared with those of the
forest-bed or the pleiocene age on the one hand, and with
the late pleistocene on the other, it will be seen that they
are linked to the former by <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros megarhinus</i>, and to
the latter by the musk sheep. The presence of the latter,
the most arctic of the herbivores, in such strange company
is most abnormal, and suggests the idea that the remains
belong to two distinct eras. The skull, however, which
I found at Crayford in 1867, and presented to the
Museum of the Geological Survey, rested in intimate
association with the bones of other species, is in the
same mineral state, and bears no marks of being a “derived
fossil.” It is the only trace of the animal as yet
obtained from the lower brick-earths.</p>

<p>The absence of the reindeer, so numerous in the valley
of the Thames, while the late pleistocene strata were
being accumulated by the river, and the abundance of
remains of the stag, seem to me to point backwards
rather than forwards in time, and to imply that the
lower brick-earths are not of late pleistocene age; just
as the absence of the characteristic early pleistocene
species shows that they are not of that age. The
evidence seems to be sufficient to establish a stage
intermediate between the two. Nevertheless, it is
sufficiently conflicting to cause Dr. Falconer to come
to the conclusion that these strata are of pleiocene date,
and Mr. Prestwich to believe that they belong to a late
stage in the pleistocene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">417</a></span>
During the middle pleistocene, in the Thames valley,
and at Clacton, the woolly rhinoceros, elephant, and
mammoth competed for the same feeding-grounds with
<i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros hemitœchus</i>, <i class="taxonomy">R. megarhinus</i>, hippopotamus,
and <i class="taxonomy">Elephas antiquus</i>. Although all the characteristic
pleiocene deer had retreated, the reindeer had not yet invaded
that area: it was occupied by the stag, roe, the
Irish elk, and Brown’s fallow deer. The whole assemblage
of animals, the musk sheep being excepted, implies that
the climate was less severe at this time, than when the
reindeer spread over the same area in the late pleistocene
age, and was far more numerous than the stag. It
may, indeed, be objected that the classificatory value of
the musk sheep is quite as great as that of <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros
megarhinus</i>; but in the case of the lower brick-earths,
the evidence of the latter as to climate agrees with that
of the whole assemblage of animals, while that of the
former is altogether discordant.</p>

<p>There are no caves either in Britain or on the continent
which can be referred with certainty to this middle
division. The machairodus, however, of Kent’s Hole,
and of the cavern of Baume in the Jura (see <a href="#Page_337">p. 337</a>), and
the megarhine species of rhinoceros from the fissures of
Oreston, probably inhabited those regions, while the temperate
group of animals held possession of the valley of
the Thames, and of that now sunk beneath the North Sea.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_190"><i>The Early Pleistocene Mammalia.</i></h3>

<p>The fossil mammalia must now be examined, which
inhabited Great Britain during the early pleistocene
period, and before the maximum severity of glacial cold
had as yet been reached. The fossil bones from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">418</a></span>
forest-bed, which underlies the boulder-clay on the shores
of Norfolk and Suffolk, have for many years attracted
the attention of naturalists and geologists. The magnificent
collections of the Rev. John Gunn, and the late
Rev. S.&nbsp;W. King, gave Dr. Falconer the means of proving
that the fauna of the ancient submerged forest differed
from that of any geological period which we have hitherto
discussed: and the careful diagnosis of all the fossils
from this horizon which I have been able to meet with,
shows that it was of a very peculiar character, being
closely allied to the pleiocene of the south of France and
of Italy, and yet possessing species which are undoubtedly
pleistocene. The following list is necessarily very imperfect,
since the fragmentary nature of the fossils renders
a specific identification very hazardous; and it only
includes those which I have been able to identify with
any degree of certainty.</p>

<i class="taxonomy">E. primigenius.</i>
</p>

<p>From the examination of this list, the peculiar mixture
of pleiocene and pleistocene species is evident. The
<i class="taxonomy">Ursus arvernensis</i>, <i class="taxonomy">Cervus Polignacus</i>, <i class="taxonomy">Hippopotamus
major</i>, <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros etruscus</i>, and <i class="taxonomy">R. megarhinus</i>, the horse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">419</a></span>
<i class="taxonomy">Elephas meridionalis</i>, and <i class="taxonomy">E. antiquus</i> were living in the
pleiocene age in France and Italy, and probably in Norfolk.
The cave-bear, the wolf, fox, mole, beaver, Irish elk, roe,
stag, urus, wild-boar, and the mammoth have not as
yet been discovered in the continental pleiocenes, as
judged by the standards offered by the Val d’Arno and
Southern France. They are more or less abundant in the
late pleistocene age. This singular association seems to
me to imply that the fauna of the forest-bed is intermediate
between the two, and, from the fact that only three
out of the whole series, viz. <i class="taxonomy">Ursus arvernensis</i>, <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros
etruscus</i>, and <i class="taxonomy">Cervus Polignacus</i>, are peculiar to
the continental pleiocene, that it is more closely allied
to the pleistocene than to the pleiocene.</p>

<p>It is also very probable that this early pleistocene age
was of considerable duration; for in it we find at least
two forms (and the number will probably be very largely
increased) which are unknown in continental Europe,
although pleiocene and pleistocene strata have been
diligently examined in France and Germany. The very
presence of the <i class="taxonomy">Cervus Sedgwickii</i> and <i class="taxonomy">C. verticornis</i>
implies that the lapse of time was sufficiently great to
allow of the evolution of forms of animal life hitherto
unknown, and which disappeared before the middle and
late pleistocene stages. The <i class="taxonomy">Trogontherium</i> also, as well
as the <i class="taxonomy">Cervus carnutorum</i>, both of which occur in the
forest-bed and in the gravel-beds of St. Prest, near
Chartres, and which are peculiar to this horizon, point
to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The deer of the forest-bed, in this list, do not represent
approximately the number of species: there are at
least five, and perhaps six, represented by a series of
antlers, which I do not venture to quote, because I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">420</a></span>
not been able to compare them with those of the pleiocenes
of the Val d’Arno, of Marseilles, or of Auvergne.</p>

<p>Dr. Falconer pointed out that one of the peculiar
characters of the fauna of the forest-bed is the presence
of the mammoth; and the evidence on which he considered
the animal to be of preglacial age in Europe has
been fully verified by the molars from Bacton, which are
now in the Manchester Museum. They are associated
with <i class="taxonomy">Elephas meridionalis</i> and <i class="taxonomy">E. antiquus</i>, and are
incrusted with precisely the same matrix as the teeth
and bones of those species.</p>

<p>No caves have been discovered containing this peculiar
assemblage of fossil animals.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_191"><i>The Pleiocene Mammalia.</i></h3>

<p>The relation of the pleistocene to the pleiocene fauna
is a question of very great difficulty, because the
latter has not yet been satisfactorily defined, although
Prof. Gervais and Dr. Falconer have given the more
important species from Auvergne, Montpellier, and the
Val d’Arno. The following list is taken from Prof.
Gervais’s great work “Zoologie et Paléontologie Françaises,”
p. 349, the term pseudo-pleiocene merely implying
that the fauna differs from that of the marine
deposit of Montpellier, which he takes as his standard.</p>

<p>All these animals, with the exception of <i class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros

of Issoire, while the megarhine rhinoceros and
<i class="taxonomy">Mastodon arvernensis</i> are the only two which have been
obtained from the marine sands of Montpellier. The
pleiocene animals, therefore, inhabiting Northern Italy
are more closely allied to those of Auvergne than to
those of Montpellier.</p>

<p>If these three localities be taken as typical of the
pleiocene strata, we shall find that several of the species
range as far north as Britain, and occur in deposits which
from the evidence of the mollusca, have been assigned to
that age. <i class="taxonomy">Mastodon arvernensis</i>, <i class="taxonomy">Elephas meridionalis</i>,
and <i class="taxonomy">Ursus arvernensis</i>, have been obtained from the old
land-surface which underlies the sand and shingle of the
Norfolk Crag, in company with many forms of deer and
antelopes which have not yet been identified, while the
<i class="taxonomy">Hipparion</i> is found in the marine crags of Suffolk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">423</a></span>
The animals which especially characterize the pleiocene

<i class="taxonomy">Mastodon arvernensis</i> and <i class="taxonomy">M. Borsoni</i>, besides the

<p>If this fauna be compared with that of the preglacial
forest-bed, it will be seen that the difference between
them is very great. The pleiocene mastodon, tapir, the
majority of the deer, and the antelopes are replaced
by forms such as the roe and the red-deer, unknown up
to that time. Nevertheless many of the pleiocene animals
were able to hold their ground against the pleistocene
invaders, although, subsequently, as I have already
shown, they disappeared one by one, being ultimately
beaten in the struggle for life by the new comers. The
progress of this struggle has been used in the preceding
pages as a means of classification. This fauna has not
been discovered in any cave.</p>

<p>The three subdivisions of the pleistocene do not apply
to the region south of the Alps and Pyrenees, because the
northern group of animals did not pass into Spain and
Italy. In these two countries we find southern and
pleiocene animals living throughout the pleistocene age,
which in France and Britain lived only in the two earlier
stages.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_193"><i>Antiquity of Man in Europe.</i></h3>

<p>No remains have been discovered up to the present
time in any part of Europe which can be referred with
certainty to a higher antiquity than the pleistocene age.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">425</a></span>
The palæolithic people or peoples arrived in Europe along
with the peculiar fauna of that age, and after dwelling
here for a length of time, which is to be measured by the
vast physical and climatal changes, described in the last
three chapters, finally disappeared, leaving behind as
their representatives the Eskimos tribes of arctic America.
There is no evidence that they were inferior in
intellectual capacity to many of the lower races of the
present time, or more closely linked to the lower animals.
The traces which they have left behind tell us nothing
as to the truth or falsehood of the doctrine of evolution,
for if it be maintained on the one hand, that the first
appearance of man as a man, and not as a man-like
brute, is inconsistent with that doctrine, it may be
answered that the lapse of time between his appearance
in the pleistocene age and the present day, is too small
to have produced appreciable physical or intellectual
change. Also, it must not be forgotten, that we have
merely investigated the antiquity of the sojourn of man
in Europe, and not the general question of his first
appearance on the earth, with which it is very generally
confounded. Dr. Falconer well remarked that the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">origines</i> of mankind are to be sought, not in Europe,
but in the tropical regions, probably of Asia. To these
we have no clue in the present stage of the inquiry.
The higher apes are represented in the European meiocene
and pleiocene strata, by extinct forms uniting in
some cases the characters of different living species, but
they do not show any tendency to assume human characters.
It must indeed be allowed, that the study of
fossil remains throws as little light as the documents of
history on the relation of man to the lower animals.
The historian commences his labours with the high civilization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">426</a></span>
of Assyria and Egypt, and can merely guess at
the steps by which it was achieved; the palæontologist
meets with the traces of man in the pleistocene strata,
and he too can merely guess at the antecedent steps by
which man arrived even at that culture which is implied
by the implements. The latter has proved that the
antiquity of man is greater than the former had supposed.
Neither has contributed anything towards the
solution of the problem of his origin.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_194"><i>Man lived in India in Pleistocene Age.</i></h3>

<p>The researches of the Geological Surveyors has shown
that in ancient times man, in the same stage of civilization
as the palæolithic man of Europe, lived in
Southern India and in the valley of the Narbadá. In
1868<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Mr. Bruce Foote described the flint implements
which were discovered over a large area in the districts
of Madras, either in the red clayey deposit known as
Laterite, or in such positions as implied that they had
been washed out of it. They all belong to the same
rude types as those of the pleistocene strata of North-western
Europe. A small fragment of bone was the
only fossil which had up to that time been discovered in
the Laterite, and this I was able to identify in 1869 as
a portion of a human tibia of the abnormal platycnemic
variety, which has been described in the <a href="#CHAPTER_V">fifth</a> chapter of
this work, from the European caves and tombs. The
Lateritic deposits themselves are strictly analogous
to our river-strata and brick-earths in their constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">427</a></span>
and in their resting at various levels above the
sea, and were, as Mr. Foote remarks, formed under
conditions different to those which are now going on in
that district. They prove that the period of the sojourn
of palæolithic man in Southern India is divided from the
present day by considerable geographical changes, such
as the elevation of land, and the erosion and breaking
up of accumulations which were once continuous. We
have seen that somewhat similar changes have happened
in Europe, in the interval which separates the palæolithic
period from our own time.</p>

<p>The discovery of a rudely chipped implement of
quartzite, of the pointed oval shape common in the
gravels of Britain and France, published by Mr. Medlicott
in 1873, in the “Records of the Geological Survey
of India,” proves further that man was a member of the
remarkable fauna which inhabited the valley of the
Narbadá in ancient times. It was dug out of reddish
unstratified clay by Mr. Hacket at a depth of three feet
from the upper surface, which was covered by twenty
feet of ossiferous gravel, on the left bank of the Narbadá
near the valley of Bhutra. The clay belongs to
the same fluviatile series as that from which the
mammalia were obtained and named by Dr. Falconer
in 1828. Both clay and gravel are shown to be of
fluviatile origin, by the presence of fresh-water mussels
of the varieties still living in the adjacent river.</p>

<p>The fossil bones belong to extinct and living animals.
Among the former are two kinds of elephant (<i class="taxonomy">E. namadicus</i>)
and (<i class="taxonomy">E. stegodon insignis</i>), one of which is closely
allied to the European <i class="taxonomy">E. antiquus</i>, two species of hippopotamus,
one (<i class="taxonomy">H. palæindicus</i>) with four incisors in front
of the jaws like the African, and a second with six incisors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">428</a></span>
belonging to the extinct division of hexaprotodon, a
large ox (<i class="taxonomy">Bos namadicus</i>), a deer and a bear. The
living forms are represented by the buffalo (<i class="taxonomy">Bubalus
namadicus</i>), which is identical with the wild arnee from
which the Indian domestic buffaloes have descended,
and the gavial, or long-snouted Gangetic crocodile. This
imperfect list, borrowed from Dr. Falconer,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> shows that
there is the same mixture of extinct with living forms
in the valley of the Ganges, while the clays and gravels
were being accumulated, as we have observed in the
pleistocene deposits of Europe, and the fauna may therefore
be referred to the pleistocene age, and probably, as
Mr. Medlicott proposes, to the late division of that
age. The exact correspondence of the quartzite implements
with those which are so abundant in the European
river-strata of the same age, adds additional weight to
this conclusion.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_195"><i>Are the Palæolithic Aborigines of India related to those of Europe?</i></h3>

<p>It is not a little remarkable that Dr. Falconer, writing
in 1865 of the peculiar fauna of the Narbadá, should
have held the view that man was living in India at that
time, and that the memory of the hippopotamus was
handed down in Aryan traditions, under the striking
name of the water elephant. “After reflecting,” he
writes, “on the question during many years in its
palæontological and ethnological bearings, my leaning is
to the view that <i class="taxonomy">Hippopotamus namadicus</i> was extinct
in India long before the Aryan invasion, but that it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">429</a></span>
familiar to the earlier indigenous races.” (ii. p. 644.)
This inference is proved to be literally true by the
discovery of the palæolithic implements in the ossiferous
strata of the Narbadá, which must have required long
ages for their accumulation and subsequent erosion.</p>

<p>We may, therefore, conclude that palæolithic man
inhabited both Europe and India in the pleistocene age.
And possibly the identity of the implements, in these
two remote regions, may be accounted for in the same
manner as the identity of Aryan root-words, by the view
that their fabricators may have come from the same
centre of dispersal, by the same routes as those which
were subsequently used by the pre-Aryan, and Aryan,
invaders of Europe and India. But whether this be
accepted or not, it cannot be denied that the man who
inhabited both these regions was in the same rude
stage of human progress, and played his part in the
same life-era.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_196"><i>Palæolithic Man lived in Palestine.</i></h3>

<p>The discovery, by the Abbé Richard,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> of a palæolithic
flint implement, of the ordinary river-bed type, on the
surface of a stratum of gravel between Mount Tabor and
the lake of Tiberias, lends great weight to the view that
the Aborigines of India and Europe, whose implements
are found in the deposits of rivers, migrated from the
same centre, since it bridges over the great interval of
space by which they were isolated. It is very probable,
that future discoveries may reveal the presence of a
tolerably uniform priscan population, in the pleistocene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">430</a></span>
age, throughout this vast area: which as yet has only
been explored by archæologists in a few isolated points,
with the important results recorded in the preceding
pages.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_197"><i>Conclusion.</i></h3>

<p>It now remains for us to sum up the results of the
exploration of European caves, of which an imperfect
outline has been given in this work. Their formation,
and filling up, have an important bearing on the physical
geography of the districts in which they occur, and
reveal the great changes which are going on, in the
calcareous rocks, at the present time. The study of the
remains which they contain has led to the recognition of
the fact, that the climate and geography of Europe, in
ancient times, were altogether different from those of
the present day.</p>

<p>It has also made large additions to the history of the
sojourn of man in Europe. We find a hunting and
fishing race of cave-dwellers, in the remote pleistocene
age, in possession of France, Belgium, Germany, and
Britain, probably of the same stock as the Eskimos, living
and forming part of a fauna, in which northern and
southern, living and extinct, species are strangely mingled
with those now living in Europe. In the neolithic age
caves were inhabited, and used for tombs, by men of the
Iberian or Basque race, which is still represented by the
small, dark-haired, peoples of western Europe. They
were rarely used in the bronze age. When we arrive
within the borders of history in Britain, we find them
offering shelter to the Brit-Welsh flying from their
enemies after the ruin of the Roman empire, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">431</a></span>
throwing great light on the fragmentary records of those
obscure times. In treating of these questions, it has
been necessary to discuss problems of deep and varied
interest to the ethnologist, physicist, and historian, some
of which have been partially solved, while others await
the light of the higher knowledge which will be the
fruit of a wider experience.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_198"><i>Instruments used in Cave-hunting.</i></h3>

<p>The instruments which Mr. James Parker, Mr. Ayshford Sanford
and myself have found most valuable in cave-hunting, apart
from the tools of the workman, are as <span class="locked">follow:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. A hammer with an ash handle about twenty inches long,
inserted into a square head of best steel, ending in a chisel edge
in the same plane as the handle, weighing almost eight ounces,
and seven inches in length.</p>

<p>2. A steel chisel ten inches long.</p>

<p>3. A prismatic compass.</p>

<p>4. A thermometer for taking the temperatures of the air and
water.</p>

<p>5. An aneroid.</p>

<p>6. A steel measuring tape.</p>

<p>7. Abney’s patent level which is used for laying down datum-line
for plan, as well as for taking the dips and angles.</p>

<p>In making a plan we have found it useful to mark the datum-line
by a stout string or wire and to measure from it as the work
proceeds, indicating on the sides and floor of the cave the points
of measurement, with paint or wooden pegs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436">436</a></span>
8. A stout rope not less than twenty feet long with a horse’s
girth at the end is necessary for the exploration of vertical fissures,
so that the explorer may be let down without any great danger.
No large unknown caves should be explored without a rope, or
by a party less than three in number. In exploring the caves
of Burrington Combe we used a rope sixty feet long. The descent
into Helln Pot, described in the <a href="#CHAPTER_II">second</a> chapter, <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>, was
effected in the following manner. A strong platform of timber
was made over the open fissure, and from it a square
“cage” or “basket” of the ordinary kind used in mining was
let down for the first drop of 198 feet. It was prevented from
twisting round by two guide ropes. For the rest of the falls we
had two ladders eight feet long, and a rope, without which we
should have been unable to reach the bottom.</p>

<div id="if_i_436" class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">
  <img src="images/i_436.jpg" width="338" height="126" alt="" /></div>

<p>9. In the exploration of water-caves, in which there are sometimes
sheets of water of considerable size and depth, a raft may
be used, such as that devised by Mr. James Parker for the
navigation of the great cave of Wookey Hole. It consisted of a
platform supported on barrels and built as follows: A frame of
stout poles was made; two, <i>a a</i>, being eight feet long, with four
others, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, lashed firmly across, each four feet in length. The space
<i>d</i> was converted into a platform by nailing boards across, and
this was buoyed up by a beer-barrel at each end in the interspace
<i>e</i>. The barrels were attached to the raft by two loops of rope <i>g</i>,
passing over from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, and thus kept in place, although they
freely twisted and turned in actual use. The ropes had an advantage
over iron hoops for the attachment of the barrels, because
when they were tightened the platform was raised above the
water, when they were loosened it was lowered, and thus the
raft could be adjusted to the weight to be carried, to the depth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">437</a></span>
of the water, and the distance of the water-line from the roof.
A raft of this kind will bear three persons, and is sufficiently
light to be carried over the shallows. With it Mr. Parker made
his way for a considerable distance in the Wookey Hole cavern,
and subsequently I penetrated as far as the water-line would
allow me to get. A long pole is also necessary for punting.
Mr. Parker found by experience that a raft made of boards
nailed on the top of two beer-barrels was too unstable to be of
any use. In making his way across subterranean pools the cave-hunter
ought to be prepared for accidents, for the depth is very
uncertain, and the water sufficiently cold to cause cramp. For
the exploration of ordinary water-caves a raft is unnecessary,
but no attempt should be made without a rope. In Yorkshire
and Derbyshire there is an unlimited field for adventure in the
subterranean water-courses.</p>

<p>10. The most convenient lights for use in caves are the common
composite candles. Paraffin candles are open to the objection
that they gutter, lanthorns do not give a sufficiently diffused
light, and the smoke of paraffin torches, or flambeaux dipped in
turpentine or tar is intolerable. Magnesium wire reveals the
beauties of the higher roofs.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_199"><i>The Search after Ossiferous Caves.</i></h3>

<p>Many of the ossiferous caves, and especially those of the
neolithic and pleistocene ages, have their entrances masked by
débris which has been accumulated from the surface above during
the long lapse of ages. In their discovery I have found rabbits,
foxes, and badgers of the greatest service, since these animals
generally make their burrows in such places. And where their
earths are met with at the base of a vertical wall of rock, I have
very generally found a cave. They were my sole guides to the
discovery of the five sepulchral caves at Perthi Chwareu, described
in the <a href="#CHAPTER_V">fifth</a> chapter, in a district in which up to that time caves
were not known to exist.</p>

<p>The dwellers in caves very generally chose for their habitations
the sunny side of the ravines and valleys, and the spots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">438</a></span>
which commanded a wide view, and, therefore, their remains
are to be looked for in those places, rather than on the cold
and sunless sides, or where an enemy might approach without
observation.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_200"><i>The Scientific Methods of Cave-digging.</i></h3>

<p>The exploration of an ossiferous cavern with sufficient accuracy
to be of scientific value, may be carried out in all tunnel
caves, or those extending horizontally into the rock, by one of
the three following methods which may be adapted to the
local <span class="locked">conditions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The first step to take in all cases is to make a plan of the entrance,
and to cut a passage down to the rock at the entrance, so
as to obtain a clear idea of the sequence of the strata. In the
hyæna-den at Wookey Hole, we first of all cut a passage through
the cave-earth which extended from the roof to the floor, and then
removed the earth on either side in blocks, until ultimately the
chamber and passages described in the <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">eighth</a> chapter were
cleared of their contents. Our work was measured every evening,
and each bone and object found was labelled with the date
which was recorded on the ground plan. Vertical sections were
also taken from time to time. This mode, supplemented by
constant supervision of the workmen, was sufficiently accurate
to satisfy the demands of scientific research.</p>

<p>The Victoria Cave, where the demarcation between the strata
was very distinct, was explored, while the work was under my
direction up to September 1873, in a somewhat similar fashion.
It was, however, impossible on account of the great depth of the
deposits to cut a passage down to the rock at the entrance. We
therefore examined the superficial strata throughout the cave,
merely gauging the thickness of those below by sinking three
shafts. Where a cave is sufficiently high to allow of the work
being carried on, it is better to clear out one stratum before
another is disturbed.</p>

<p>The most elaborate and perfect method of cave exploration is
that which has been used by the committee in Kent’s Hole,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">439</a></span>
under the superintendence of Mr. Pengelly, who writes as
follows:<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>“The following is the method of exploration which has been
observed from the commencement, and which it is believed
affords a simple and correct method of determining the exact
position of every object which has been found.</p>

<p>“1. The black soil accessible between the masses of limestone
on the surface was carefully examined and removed.</p>

<p>“2. The limestone blocks occupying the surface of the deposits
were blasted and otherwise broken up, and taken out of
the cavern.</p>

<p>“3. A line termed the ‘datum-line,’ is stretched horizontally
from a fixed point at the entrance to another at the back of the
chamber.</p>

<p>“4. Lines, one foot apart, are drawn at right angles to the
datum-line, and therefore parallel to one another, across the
chamber so as to divide the surface of the deposit into belts
termed ‘parallels.’</p>

<p>“5. In each parallel the black mould which the limestone
masses had covered is first examined and removed, and then the
stalagmite breccia, so as to lay bare the surface of the cave-earth.</p>

<p>“6. Horizontal lines, a foot apart, are then drawn from side
to side across the vertical face of the section so as to divide the
parallel into four layers or ‘levels,’ each a foot deep.</p>

<p>“Finally each level is divided into lengths called ‘yards,’ each
three feet long, and measured right and left from the datum-line
as an axis of abscissæ.</p>

<p>“In fine, the cave-earth is excavated in vertical slices or parallels
four feet high, one foot thick, and as long as the chamber is
broad, where this breadth does not exceed thirty feet. Each
parallel is taken out in levels one foot high, and in each level in
horizontal prisms three feet long and a foot square in the section,
so that each contains three cubic feet of material.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_201"><i>The Stalagmitic Floor to be broken up.</i></h3>

<p>In all cases the crystalline flooring of stalagmite and stalagmitic
breccias which often occur, should be broken up, or, if
necessary, blasted with gunpowder. The former very frequently
conceals the pleistocene remains, and the latter, which is in
Kent’s Hole many feet thick, often contains the traces of man
and wild animals. Sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish
the breccia from the rocky floor.</p>

<p>Where the ossiferous deposit fills a vertical fissure it must be
worked on the same plan as in ochre-mining, by sinking a shaft.
To dig into it from below (where this is possible) is very dangerous,
because of the large imbedded stones which fall sometimes
without any warning.</p>

<h3 id="hdr_202"><i>The Preservation of Fossil Remains.</i></h3>

<p>The fossil bones and teeth, which have very generally lost
their gelatine and have a tendency to crumble and split to pieces
in drying, should be gradually dried, and from time to time
saturated with a weak hot solution of gelatine or glue. Silicate
of soda, sometimes called “liquid glass,” or melted paraffin (not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">441</a></span>
the oil), may also be used for the same purpose. If the bones
are extremely soft, they may be rescued from destruction by
letting them dry in the matrix, saturating them and the matrix
with a solution of gelatine, and then clearing off the latter. In
this manner I preserved the skull of the musk sheep which is
now in the Museum of the Geological Survey in Jermyn Street,
London.</p>

<p id="hdr_203" class="center"><i>Observations on the Rate at which Stalagmite is being accumulated
in the Ingleborough Cave.</i> Proceed. Lit. and Phil. Soc.
Manch. April 1873.</p></blockquote>

<p>The only attempt to measure with accuracy the rate of the
accumulation of stalagmite in caverns, in this country, is that
made by Mr. James Farrer in the Ingleborough Cave, in the
years 1839 and 1845, and published by Prof. Phillips in the
“Rivers, Mountains, and Sea Coast of Yorkshire” (second
edition, 1855, pp. 34&ndash;35). The stalagmite of which the measurements
were taken is that termed, from its shape, the Jockey
Cap. It rises from a crystalline pavement to a height of about
two and a half feet, and is the result of a deposit of carbonate
of lime, brought down by a line of drops that fall into a basin
at its top, and flow over the general surface. On March 13th,
1873, in company with Mr. John Birkbeck and Mr. Walker, I
was enabled by the kindness of Mr. Farrer to take a set of
measurements, to be recorded for use in after years.</p>

<p>For the sake of insuring accuracy in future observations, three
holes were bored at the base of the stalagmite, and three gauges
of brass wire, gilt, inserted; gauge No. 1 in the following table
being that on the S.S.E., No. 2 on N.N.E., No. 3 on the West side.
The curvilinear dimensions were taken with fine iron wire, or
with a steel measure; and the circumferential around the base
along a line marked by the three gauges. The measurements 2,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">443</a></span>
3, and 4 of the table were taken on the 15th of March, by Mr.
Walker, and their accuracy may be tested by the fact that they
coincide exactly with No. 1, which I took two days before.</p>

<p>The lengths of wire, properly labelled, are deposited in the
Manchester Museum, the Owens College, for future observers.</p>

<p>In the following table I have given my own measurements
and compared them with those taken by Mr. Farrer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have been unable to identify the exact spots
where the stalagmite was measured by Mr. Farrer, so that the
only measurement which affords any trustworthy data for estimating
the rate of increase is number 14. With regard to this,
the only possible ground of error is the erosion of the general
surface of the solid limestone, of which the roof is composed, by
carbonic acid, since the year 1845, and this is so small as to be
practically inappreciable. We have, therefore, evidence that
the Jockey’s Cap is growing at the rate of ·2946 of an inch per
annum, and that if the present rate of growth be continued it
will finally arrive at the roof in about 295 years. But even this
comparatively short lapse of time will probably be diminished by
the growth of a pendent stalactite above, that is now being
formed in place of that which measured ten inches in 1845, and
has since been accidentally destroyed. It is very possible that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">444</a></span>
the Jockey Cap may be the result not of the continuous but of
the intermittent drip of water containing a variable quantity of
carbonate of lime, and that, therefore, the present rate of growth
is not a measure of its past or future condition. Its possible
age in 1845 was estimated by Prof. Phillips at 259 years, on
the supposition that the grain of carbonate of lime in each
pint was deposited. If, however, it grew at its present rate it
may be not more than 100 years old. All the stalagmites and
stalactites in the Ingleborough Cave may not date further
back than the time of Edward III. if the Jockey Cap be taken
as a measure of the rate of deposition.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> When the English conquered Somerset from the Brit-Welsh, they
translated the Celtic Ogo into Hole, whence the cave and village of
Wookey Hole were named, just as they translated a neighbouring
hill, called Pen, into Knowle, the generic Celtic term in each case
being used to specify a particular object. There are many other
instances of the like use of a Celtic name by the English conquerors
of the Celts. In the Limestone plateau of Llanamynech,
near Oswestry, there is a cave called “The Ogo.”</p></div>

the circumference to the centre, the other from the centre to the circumference.</p></div>

neolithic age, was probably due, as is suggested by my friend Mr. John
Evans, F.R.S., to the habit of sleeping in that posture and not at full
length on a bed. The body was not laid out after death, but may
have been folded together, as in the case of the ancient Peruvian mummies.
No regularity, however, in the contracted posture could be
observed in the many tumuli and caves which I have explored, although
very generally the corpse had been interred on its side.</p></div>

Welsh crania stand high in the scale&mdash;quite as high as any of the existing races
of mankind. I have made the comparison in a rough way in the following
manner:&mdash;

<p>
If the numbers representing the <em>length</em>, <em>breadth</em>, and <em>height</em> of the skull are
added together, a number is obtained which will, of course, in some measure,
indicate the gross dimensions of the skull. From the rather numerous data
furnished by my own Tables of Measurements I obtained the results stated in
the subjoined list, in which the gross mean dimensions of various sets of crania

M. Broca takes a different point of view to that advanced in these

we have already obtained of the Aryans by the same means. It is

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_196" href="#FNanchor_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> An incident connected with our work illustrates remarkably the
attachment which a dog will suddenly show towards a stranger. In
our lodging at Wells there was a beautiful Scotch deerhound, named
“Luna,” whose master was away at the time. Luna persisted in
being with us day and night. In the morning she walked with
us to the cave, and lay watching at the entrance till we came out, for
she was afraid to venture into the darkness. In the evening she
returned home with us. She continued to do this the whole time of
that year’s excavations. It was only natural to suppose that when we
left she would, like other dogs, pick up new friends. But she did
nothing of the kind. When we inquired the next year upon our return,
we were told that poor Luna refused food the day we left, and
gradually pined away and died.</p></div>

that the mixture of the northern and southern forms is due to the
destruction of ossiferous strata by streams, which subsequently deposited
remains of widely different ages together, is rendered untenable
by the fact that they are generally preserved in the same mineral state.
It would have been impossible for this to have taken place without
leaving decided traces behind in the rolled and water-worn condition
of the older series, such as may be seen in the case of the eocene and
meiocene fossils in the Red Crag of Suffolk.</p></div>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks retained.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>The corrections listed in “Additions and Corrections” at the
beginning of the book have been made to the main text of this
eBook. The additions have not been added. The errors listed
for pages 196 and 201 were not found in the text, and both
the opening and closing inverted commas (quotation marks)
have been removed on page 386.</p>

<p>Unlike the printed book, all illustrations in this eBook
appear between paragraphs, so the page references in the
List of Illustrations do not necessarily match their actual
positions. However, links, in versions of this eBook that support
them, do lead directly to the corresponding illustrations.</p>

<p>The Index was not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references.</p>

<p>Text has many references to “Lartet” and just a few to “Lortet”. They
seem to refer to the same person, but both are listed in the Index,
so both spellings have been retained.</p>

<p>Text refers to “Rev. J. MacEnery”, “Rev. J. McEnery” and “McEnery”. These
all refer to the same person, but the correct spelling is uncertain, so
both variations have been retained.</p>

<p>Some of the fractional numbers (e.g., 1/1, 1/2) in illustration captions
were unclear and may have been incorrectly transcribed.</p>

<p>In some tables, a special space character was used to align decimals. Display
software that does not support that character may show a question mark in its place.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_2">2</a>: “dwellings of evil spirits” was misprinted as “swellings”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_147">147</a>: Footnote 95 (originally 2) was not referenced in the text.
Transcriber has arbitrarily placed a reference to it.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_199">199</a>: “Valcleuse” currently is spelled “Valcluse”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_310">310</a>: The reference to “Figs. 92, 93” was misprinted
as “Figs. 92, 33” and has been corrected here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_339">339</a>: Identifications of the three illustrations were added
by Transcriber.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_381">381</a>: The top of the map was close to the physical book’s binding and
was distorted during scanning. The Transcriber attempted to remedy this
distortion.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_436">436</a>: The letters in the diagram were printed in italics. For readability,
the Plain Text version of this eBook omits the underscores that indicate italics.
The HTML and mobile versions use an image of the diagram.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_449">449</a> (Index): “Caves, used as places of refuge” gave no page reference.
The Table of Contents refers to page 102, and the Transcriber added that to the index entry.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
